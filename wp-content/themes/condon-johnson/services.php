                        <p class="text">Jet grouting improves the mechanical characteristics of the soil using a high-pressure fluid jet that breaks up the soil structure and mixes the soil particles in-situ with a self-hardening grout to create a homogeneous column of soil-cement material</p>
                        <p class="text">A small diameter hole is drilled through the layer of soil requiring treatment. Once at the bottom of the proposed column, grout is pumped through the drill rods to one or more injection nozzles where the fluid exits at a very high velocity through one or several small diameter injection nozzles at the tip of the drilling rod. The drilling rod is rotated and withdrawn at a controlled speed to form a column or with no rotation to form a panel</p>

Drilled shafts, also known as drilled piers, Cast-in-Drilled-Hole Piles (CIDH piles) or Cast-in-Situ piles are used to transfer structural loads and moments through the relatively weak upper strata of many sites to deeper, stronger soils which have sufficient capacity for the anticipated loading</p>
                        <p class="text">Drilled shafts are deep, cylindrical, cast-in-place concrete foundations reinforced using full-length rebar cages and formed by a drilled borehole excavation. They can range in diameter from 18-inches to greater than 20-feet and reach depths over 250 feet. They are often used as a structural support where seismic  loadings create large moment requirements with  ultimately govern the bridge foundation design. Drilled shafts have additional foundation uses including, building support, cantilevered signs, communication towers, and landslide retention...</p>

Once the pile has been grouted and auger completely removed from the pile, reinforcing cages may then be wet set into the previously placed concrete</p>
