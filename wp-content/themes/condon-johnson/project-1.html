                            CJA was contracted by Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Co. to install auger cast displacement piles (ACDP) for a 5-story new commercial building in the Playa Vista Development. The project consisted of 2 building in 2 parcels across the street from each other connected via a bridge. The contract was in two parts, a test program and a production program.CJA installed a test program and conducted load test. The load test results achieved were higher than anticipated and Condon-Johnson was able to reduce the quantity of piles saving the Owner time and cost on the project.The final design consisted of 1,408 ACDP’s with an average design depth of 50 feet below grade. This project was slightly different regarding depth. Typically, depths are known prior to drilling piles. On this project each pile was drilled until a minimum torque of 180,000 foot-lbs was sustained for 4 feet vertical feet into a dense sand layer at depth. The center bar had to be specialty cut to depth for each pile based on when the minimum torque was sustained for 4 feet vertical feet per pile. The final average depth was 45 feet below grade.

                            Condon-Johnson (CJA) & West Coast General joint ventured on this design-build public works project. The city of Chula Vista was in need of a secant pile wall for the purpose of protecting Telegraph Canyon road from the erosion that has been occurring in a nearby creek. The secant pile wall consisted of 30” diameter piles that spanned a length of 770’. Soils had potential for caving and water was present. CJA utilized a dual-head secant pile drilling technique where both the casing and hollow stem auger are simultaneously drilled into the ground and concrete is pumped through auger during tooling withdrawal.

                                The University Village was originally constructed in the 1950’s and is underlain by a peat layer above a silty/sand layer with a water table 1-ft below existing grade. As part of a seismic upgrade for the village, micropiles were selected to support the reaction frame to the limited access.

                            <p>
                                Due to the complexity of the project, Condon-Johnson was contracted to install 96 ea. limited access micropiles inside the shopping village. The micropiles were located inside four separate stores at the shopping village and had a very limited staging room consisting of 7 parking spots. Additionally, the entire shopping center had to remain open to the public for the full duration of the project, Condon-Johnson was to not interfere with any of the stores schedules, and all of the work had to be performed between the hours of 10pm to 10am.

CJA has constructed a series of temporary soil nail walls to facilitate the replacement of the stage and sub-stage dressing rooms. Along with the shoring, CJA has been contracted to install permanent micropile foundations for the erection of a new lighting trellis.

                                CJA was contracted with Flatiron West, Inc. to install the CIDH piles for a two phase bridge that spans the Los Angeles River, the Metrolink rails, and is tucked between Interstate 5 & 110 Freeway. CJA is currently in the process of finishing the second phase of work, which includes 1 ea. 96-inch diameter and 22 ea. 24-inch wet CIDH Piles. The 96-inch diameter CIDH pile was completed while working between the Phase 1 Bridge and the Interstate 5 Highway. The tight access provided multiple challenges, from fitting the counter weights of the BG40 underneath the Phase 1 Bridge, to utilizing a 350 ton hydraulic crane with the assistance of a 75 ton crane to pick an 80,000 pound cage off the top of the Phase 1 Bridge. Multiple key personnel successfully managed and lent support for the critical CIDH work.

                                CJA was contracted by Garden Communities to design and build approximately 11,500 square feet of temporary shoring and 44,750-feet of Auger Displacement Piling. CJA utilized beams ranging from W14x34 to W21x50 for the tiebacks and cantilever portions of work. There were 63 tie backs drilled up to 55 feet long, consisting of two and three strand anchors, as well as approximately 500-feet of cantilever shoring due to City roadway restrictions. The tiebacks were necessary due to limited lot size and poor soils conditions to facilitate construction for underground parking.

                                The state funded $555M central courthouse has 22 stories and helps develop a civic zone in downtown San Diego where city, county, federal and court facilities can be centrally located within close proximity to each other. This courthouse was necessary since the three courthouses that it will replace are significantly outdated and one of them is considered unsafe by today’s standards as it is located on a major fault line. CJA’s scope of the project is to install soldier pile shoring for the courthouse, a bridge pier cap as well as CIDH piles for a pedestrian bridge that will link the new courthouse to the existing Hall of Justice. The courthouse footprint is a full city block, which required 36,000 square feet of shoring and 142 piles that extended below the water table.

                                CJA was contracted by Avalon Bay Communities, Inc. to design and construct a relatively water tight perimeter shoring system. CJA contracted DRS Engineering, Inc. to assist with the design. The design consisted of a 301 ea. triple axis Cement Deep Soil Mix (CDSM) panels to a depth of 50 feet below grade along the project perimeter with beams in every other column. CJA utilized two beam sizes, W16x40 beams in a cantilever condition and W16x36 with walers and tie backs. There were 117 tie backs drilled to 40 – 45 feet depths, consisting of three and four strand anchors. The tie backs were necessitated due to a deeper excavation for an underground parking portion. Rakers were used at the North East corner due to an existing electrical tower.

                                The city of San Ramon contracted with CJA to install 1173-feet of secant piling to shore-up 85-feet of an access road that was succumbing to erosion from an adjacent stream. The piles were arranged in a repeating arch-shaped pattern with 3 ea. 24-inch dia. soft piles between 30-inch dia. hard piles with W21x93 beams. The narrow width of the access road posed some logistical challenges with spoils management and concrete delivery. Spoils were placed into a F550 dump truck and hauled to a stockpile 1,000-feet away and concrete trucks were backed down the road 1,500-feet to the pump.

                                In 1999, Unit 2 of the coal fired power plant in Healy, Alaska was shut down for not meeting the environmental requirements for nitrogen oxide emissions. In order to restart Unit 2, a selective catalytic reduction systems was added to the existing plant. Part of this retrofit, required micropiles to support the new equipment inside the plant.

                                Condon-Johnson & Associates was hired as the specialty contractor for the limited access micropiles inside the existing power plant. The micropiles design requirements consisted of a 152-kip compression, 96-kip tension, and 34-kip lateral load criteria for each micropile. Part of the installation program included a sacrificial test program in which 3 ea. micropiles were installed and tested to a 468-kip compression load, 288-kip tension load, and 100-kip lateral load.
