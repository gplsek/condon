                                <p class="text">Jet grouting improves the mechanical characteristics of the soil using a high-pressure fluid jet that breaks up the soil structure and mixes the soil particles in-situ with a self-hardening grout to create a homogeneous column of soil-cement material</p>
                                <p class="text">A small diameter hole is drilled through the layer of soil requiring treatment. Once at the bottom of the proposed column, grout is pumped through the drill rods to one or more injection nozzles where the fluid exits at a very high velocity through one or several small diameter injection nozzles at the tip of the drilling rod. The drilling rod is rotated and withdrawn at a controlled speed to form a column or with no rotation to form a panel</p>
