The load test results achieved were higher than anticipated and Condon-Johnson was able to reduce the quantity of piles saving the Owner time and cost on the project.\r\nThe final design consisted of 1,408 ACDP’s with an average design depth of 50 feet below grade. This project was slightly different regarding depth. Typically, depths are known prior to drilling piles. On this project each pile was drilled until a minimum torque of 180,000 foot-lbs was sustained for 4 feet vertical feet into a dense sand layer at depth. The center bar had to be specialty cut to depth for each pile based on when the minimum torque was sustained for 4 feet vertical feet per pile.

The 96-inch diameter CIDH pile was completed while working between the Phase 1 Bridge and the Interstate 5 Highway. The tight access provided multiple challenges, from fitting the counter weights of the BG40 underneath the Phase 1 Bridge, to utilizing a 350 ton hydraulic crane with the assistance of a 75 ton crane to pick an 80,000 pound cage off the top of the Phase 1 Bridge.

href=\"https://doaction.org/event/cape-town-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">fourth annual do_action WordPress Charity Hackathon</a> on July 15 this year. The objective of the event is to build websites for 10 different non-profit organizations in one day, an ambitious endeavor that requires a mix of different web and marketing talents working in highly concentrated teams. Participants help non-profits kick start their websites so the organizations can focus on doing what they do best &#8211; helping the local community.</p>\n<p>Hugh Lashbrooke, who is leading the organization of the event again this year, said the team has secured a new venue that will be better suited to a hackathon. <a href=\"http://workshop17.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">Workshop17</a>, a collaboration and meeting venue, will host the charity hackathon&#8217;s 70 participants (7 people per team). The event is currently half-full and is recruiting another 35 participants.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One thing the event has done for me, and others in the community, is open us up to the rest of what is happening in the city,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. &#8220;Our skills may seem pretty self-serving (building websites to make money), but they can be used for a lot more. Everyone who participates has so much fun on the day that I think they forget that it&#8217;s really work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s charities include the following organizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tygerberg Association for Persons with Physical Disabilities</li>\n<li>Kidz Adventure Camp</li>\n<li>Little Lambs Christian Day Care</li>\n<li>Iliso Care Society</li>\n<li>Daughters Of Destiny</li>\n<li>Durbanville Children&#8217;s Home</li>\n<li>The Homestead Projects for Street Children</li>\n<li>Usiko Stellenbosch</li>\n<li>Rotary Club of Constantia</li>\n<li>ASSITEJ South Africa</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cape Town WordPress community pioneered the concept of using WordPress to lift up local charities and this type of event has now spread to other areas of the world. As a member of the WordPress project&#8217;s Community Team, Lashbrooke has been working on making the do_action charity hackathons easily reproducible. It&#8217;s now part of the WordPress Community Program with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines in the community events organizer handbook</a>.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"http://doaction.org\" target=\"_blank\">doaction.org</a> website lists the upcoming hackathons and takes care of all the manual admin work that Lashbrooke did for himself for the first couple of events. The functionality is built on top of his experience in running the events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There has been a ton of interest in the event from communities around the world, and we&#8217;ve already seen successful events in Austin and Johannesburg,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. &#8220;More hackathons are scheduled for Pretoria, Beirut, and Montreal later this year. A few of the other cities that have shown interest and applied, but have not scheduled anything yet, are Fort Myers, Denver, New York City, and Ahmedabad, amongst others.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bringing the do_action charity hackathons under the official WordPress community program allows the team to offer logistical and financial support to organizers in the same way they already support WordCamp and meetup organizers. They do not have an official mentorship program set up yet, as the event types is still new, but Lashbrook said the community team does what it can to help hackathon organizers get started.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 May 2017 19:52:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"Matt: What’s in My Bag, 2017 edition\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47340\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://ma.tt/2017/05/whats-in-my-bag-2017/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19599:\"<p>I am a road warrior who has racked up several million miles over the past decade, and since I&#8217;m also working more-than-full-time running <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> (a totally distributed company) and leading <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> I need the ability to be productive wherever I can find a comfortable place to sit.

Hat tip: Jesse Schwartzman of <a href=\"http://eatingacademy.com/personal/move-defines-live\">this blog post fame</a>.</li>\n<li>Some generic <a href=\"https://www.mauijim.com/\">Maui Jim</a> polarized sunglasses with rubber nose pads, which I like for running or hiking because they don&#8217;t move around or slip even when you&#8217;re hot.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tzukuri.com/\">Tzukuri &#8220;Ford&#8221; + charger</a>, a super-cool <a href=\"https://audrey.co/\">Audrey company</a> that is like a combination of a Tile and cool sunglasses. They connect via bluetooth to your phone and can notify you when you leave them behind, or use the app to locate them. A charge lasts 30 days. I think this is only available in Australia right now, but should be coming to other countries soon. (Or just buy them on vacation in Australia.) These replaced my fancy Maison Bonnet sunglasses.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.westoneaudio.com/index.php/products/hearing-protection/es49-custom-hearing-protection.html\">Westone ES49 custom earplugs</a>, for if I go to concerts or anyplace overly loud.

I keep this in a pocket in my backpack and it helps me locate it if I lose it, or if I can&#8217;t find my phone I can press the button and it&#8217;ll make it beep. Surprisingly handy.

Hat tip: Dean.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MCW7EOW/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Airpods</a>. These are just fantastic, and I highly recommend them. I use them for calls, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/\">podcasts</a>, <a href=\"http://www.audible.com/\">audiobooks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/\">meditating</a>, <a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\">Duolingo</a>&#8230; they&#8217;ve become an essential daily product for me.

Hat tip: Jony.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E3SNO1G/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Bose QuietComfort 35</a>, wireless bluetooth headphones. I misplaced my <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2015/04/best-headphones-spring-2015-edition/\">cool WordPress Sennheisers</a> and picked these up in an airport before a long flight. They&#8217;re extremely comfortable, great battery life, and I keep an audio splitter and Lightning audio adapter in the case. I&#8217;ve hated on Bose many times in the past, but these are decent and I get why people like them, especially the comfort aspect. I am listening to them as I write this. I used <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FE8VM8Q/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Audeze EL-8 Titanium</a> for a while, which obviously sound better, but the lightning cable was unwieldy and it was annoying (and ridiculous) I couldn&#8217;t plug them into my laptop. Hat tip: Every airport electronics store.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161D1CL0/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Jabra Sport Pace bluetooth earbuds</a>, which replaced my Powerbeats for running and working out. They have been way sturdier. Pretty inexpensive, too, right now about $60. I know in theory you can run with Airpods, but I&#8217;d be too scared of one going down a street drain.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.carbonfiberdesigns.com/Carbon-Fiber-Money-Clip.html\">Cool carbon fiber money clip</a>, which I use to hold a little cash for places like street vendors that don&#8217;t take credit cards, or if I&#8217;m in another country and need to carry around currency. The site is a little sketchy, they should upgrade to <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\">WooCommerce</a>. Also pictured: The <a href=\"http://web.mta.info/metrocard/EasyPayXpress.htm\">EasyPay XPress NYC Metro Card</a>, which is super handy in New York as it auto-refills. Only downside is it doesn&#8217;t work on the PATH trains. Hat tip: Tynan and Rose.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H3BNWXA/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Vapur Shades roll-up water bottle</a>. Can hold a full liter, and rolls up to be small like this. Kind of new so I don&#8217;t have a strong opinion yet. Hat tip: Lululemon Lab in Vancouver.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MRWWV6S/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Fidget spinner</a>, I think this one from Amazon. Try one of these if you haven&#8217;t yet, they&#8217;re surprisingly addictive. If you go over to 14 on the left you&#8217;ll see a custom metal one a friend made for me. Hat tips: Zach and Xa.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016QO5YNG/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Apple Magic Mouse 2</a>. A classic. (3rd year)</li>\n<li>This is the latest <a href=\"https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-bags/Para-Backpack/_/prod8260286?rcnt=2&N=8av&cnt=7&color=LM9Y11S_0001\">Lululemon Para backpack</a>, and unlike last year&#8217;s Cruiser it&#8217;s currently available in stores and online. I dig this iteration: it has a little less padding on the shoulders, but the big front zipper pocket is super handy and in general it&#8217;s a lot more streamlined and water resistant. Om clued me in <a href=\"https://www.aersf.com/fit-pack-00006\">to a similar one from Aer</a>, I don&#8217;t know who designed it first. Hat tip: Rose.</li>\n<li>So&#8230; there are two laptops, a custom prototype 13&#8243; Automattic-logo Macbook touchbar, and the stickered 15&#8243;. I generally only travel with one of these, the 13&#8243; for shorter trips or the 15&#8243; if I&#8217;m going to be on the road for more than a few weeks. The performance is just better on the 15&#8243;. My favorite things about both are the 4 USB-C ports, that you can charge on any of them, and the Touch ID. (Automatticians after 4 years of tenure can get a custom Macbook, which we now offer with the WordPress, Automattic, or Jetpack logo. I usually get the test ones to make sure the quality is up to snuff.) I carry around the larger 87W brick from the 15&#8243;, and keep the extension cable now so it&#8217;s easier to plug in on those weak plugs on planes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016381AHE/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Kindle Oasis</a>. I still love the Kindle. I&#8217;ve started listening to audiobooks this year and the integration with Audible is cool. The Oasis is great because of the real buttons and the fact that you can flip it to hold in either hand, but it&#8217;s been the most annoying model in a few generations because the screen brightness isn&#8217;t adaptive, and it gives &#8220;low battery&#8221; warnings when the extra battery cover is low but the actual device is not, which seems to defeat the purpose. Great form factor and ergonomics though.</li>\n<li>Passport, because you never know when you&#8217;ll need to leave the country.</li>\n<li>A pocket-sized <a href=\"https://www.baronfig.com/\">Baron Fig</a> notebook, which I use in meetings to avoid my phone.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://madeby.google.com/phone/\">Google Pixel</a>. Best Android phone I&#8217;ve used, uses USB-C which I love, I love the size. I use this mostly for testing and staying current on Android, or as a backup. I use <a href=\"https://fi.google.com/\">Google Fi</a> for service on this one.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DOJDTQ0/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Forerunner 735, charger, and heart rate strap</a>. I actually <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XGD6CS4/?tag=photomatt08-20\">switched to the 935</a> since this picture was taken, but my notes apply to both. (Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/03/garmin-forerunner-935-depth-review.html\">a great review of the new 935</a>.) Garmin makes the best fitness smartwatches in the world right now. Aspects are clunky: the app is not the most elegant, the add-on watch faces and such leave something to be desired, the sleep tracking is way worse than Fitbit, and there is no fine-grained control over notifications. That said, the battery life goes 8-10 days (!) so I often don&#8217;t even bring the charger when I travel. The stats are unparalleled especially for running. It&#8217;s waterproof and can also track swimming and biking. Finally my favorite feature: the screen is always on. I know that sounds basic, but I have been driven crazy by years of Fitbit and Apple Watch require tapping or wrist gesticulations just to see the time. (Extra awkward in a meeting.) My hardcore fitness friends love this one too.

Hat tip Esther, Naoko, and my mom.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O5JARCI/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Belkin car mount</a>, really handy when renting a car and navigating around. (3rd year)</li>\n<li>This is a more-expensive but not-better version of what I had last year, which I&#8217;ll quote and actually recommend: &#8220;This is probably the least-travel-friendly thing I travel with, but the utility is so great I put up with it. It&#8217;s the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D4LBOV6/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Sennheiser Culture Series Wideband Headset</a>, which I use for podcasts, Skype, Facetime, Zoom, and Google Hangout calls with external folks and teams inside of Automattic. Light, comfortable, great sound quality, and great at blocking out background noise so you don&#8217;t annoy other people on the call. Worth the hassle.&#8221; I leave the USB-C adapter attached to this. Cable still annoys me.</li>\n<li>iPhone 7 Plus, on Verizon, with a <a href=\"https://bellroy.com/products/phone-case-3-card/i7plus/caramel\">Bellroy 3-card case</a>. If you&#8217;re a guy I highly recommend trying out a phone wallet case, it&#8217;s a game-changer to only have one thing to keep track of and not having a wallet in your back pocket is good to avoid getting misaligned. I have three cards in it, an Amex, a Visa, and my drivers license. In NYC I also squeeze in the Metrocard. Hat tip: Craig (a previous Bellroy model).</li>\n<li>The Japanese company <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TES88NK/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Maruman makes this awesome grid-paper lie-flat notebook</a>, which I fill and occasionally draw in. I love this thing, and having a work area where I can have my laptop, mouse, iPad, and this notebook all set up next to each other is my happy place. The paper is soft. Hat tip: Brian.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D3ODTNO/?tag=photomatt08-20\">9.7&#8243; iPad Pro</a> + smart keyboard cover on AT&amp;T. I didn&#8217;t expect to, but I really love this device. It gives me way more joy than my phone or my laptops. Gorgeous screen, long battery life, always connect, I can tether to it, write on it with the pen in 32, the keyboard is fast and silent, split screen is handy&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how to describe it. Like the Airpods, this product just excels in every area. I still have and need to use a laptop, but it&#8217;s less of my day and honestly because of some internal tools and security stuff we have.</li>\n<li>I ended up with this beast <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C316EIK/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Cable Matters USB-c mega-dongle to cover ethernet, VGA, HDMI, and old USB</a> . Hat tip: Automattician.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m not sure why I started using this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H2RBQUG/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Plantronics Voyager bluetooth headset</a>, but it&#8217;s really good. This might not make the cut next year as the Airpods are pretty good, but if I&#8217;m going to be on a regular (non-Facetime) phone or conference call for a few hours, this is what I turn to. Hat tip: An Uber driver.</li>\n<li>Lockpick set. (3rd year)</li>\n<li>An awesome <a href=\"https://www.1101.com/store/techo/pc/en/2017/detail_toolstoys/tt_pen.html\">Hobonichi Techo pen</a> (they have cool notebooks too), a sharpie (for signing fans&#8217; items), and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016NY7784/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Apple Pencil for the iPad Pro</a>.</li>\n<li>Two rings: one <a href=\"https://www.maisonmargiela.com/us/\">Margiala</a> one which has my lucky number 11 circled (for a long reason related to their numbering system), and one with the WordPress logo that was also a swag prototype for a ten-year tenure gift. I might wear these to remind me of something I&#8217;m trying to remember or focus on during a day.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m digging this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EN9QK6G/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Imazing 10k charger</a>: it&#8217;s a cool color, smaller and lighter than last year&#8217;s, has a USB-C port, and outputs well. I found I never needed the 20k capacity of last year&#8217;s, hence the downsize to 10k.</li>\n<li>This <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UWMCXD8/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Aukey 30W / 6A travel wall charger</a> I wish was all USB-C ports. I sometimes trickle-charge the laptop off this overnight.</li>\n<li>A really mediocre Native Union two-port USB I got from TED. Not going to link since it&#8217;s not very good because of the way it plugs in. Since the photo I replaced it with the much-more-useful <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q873I3K/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Aukey 2-port</a>, which I highly recommend and give away all the time.</li>\n<li>A pretty handy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GIQ8GOC/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Ventev dashport car port charger that&#8217;s small and light</a>. I found myself rarely using the USB-C on last year&#8217;s so I opted for smaller size and less weight in this one.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VM2OPHY/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Mintia mints</a> from Japan, yum. (I buy these there or ask friends to bring them back, they are much cheaper there than the cost on Amazon.)</li>\n<li>This rat&#8217;s nest of cables and adapters is embarrassing, and I will further apologize and rant in the epilogue.</li>\n<li>A random used mystery book I picked up at the <a href=\"http://paperhound.ca/\">Paper Hound Bookshop</a> in Vancouver.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What blows me away making this list is that since last year almost every single item has changed, unusually high churn. I see now why y&#8217;all were tweeting me to update this post.</p>\n<p><strong>Two bonus items:</strong> Even in the summer I&#8217;ll often have something like <a href=\"https://shop.lululemon.com/p/mens-jackets-and-hoodies-hoodies/Surge-Light-Jacket/_/prod8431221\">this light Lululemon running jacket</a> stuffed in a pocket for over air conditioned places or at the end of a flight when it gets chilly. I&#8217;m also currently testing out the <a href=\"http://www.choosemuse.com/\">assisted meditation device The Muse</a>, but it hasn&#8217;t really stuck yet and I usually just turn to <a href=\"https://calm.com/\">Calm</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ensuring network continuity:</strong> One thing you&#8217;ll notice is the iPhone is on Verizon, which has the best network in the US, the iPad is on AT&amp;T, and the Pixel is on Google Fi. This allows me to have a diversity of network access which is occasionally handy in the US and has saved my butt a few times when overseas. Whichever device has the best connection I&#8217;ll just tether the others to it. I almost never join coffee shop or hotel wifi these days, a good LTE connection is usually better.</p>\n<h3>USB-C Is Why We Can&#8217;t Have Nice Things</h3>\n<p>Oh, USB-C, I love you. You&#8217;re reversible, fast, and work for everything, like I can charge my laptop with almost anything, and many new devices like Google Wifi use you for power. The dangerous cable on Amazon thing seems to have worked itself out, and having 4 ports on the laptop is amazing, I can charge everything I need off it. But as you can see from the mess of cables and how many other legacy USB things I&#8217;m carrying around, we&#8217;re (still!) in this really awkward in-between phase for computing. First, there are no good retractable cables, especially ones that have USB-C on one end and Lightning or Micro-USB on the other. I wish my headset, headphones, sunglasses, and Kindle didn&#8217;t need Micro-USB, and I wish the Airpods, iPhone, iPad Pro, Magic Mouse would just give up on Lightning and support USB-C instead. But we&#8217;re in this liminal space, and the number one thing I hope is better by next year&#8217;s post is that the USB-C accessory world has flourished and I just have a couple of neat retractable USB-C cables and things like the battery, wall charger, and car charger in 34, 35, and 37 just have all USB-C ports. A boy can dream, right?</p>\n<h3>In Closing</h3>\n<p>Partly because the backpack is a little smaller, I&#8217;ve really tried to streamline and a lot of things from last year, like a small digital camera, the Chromecasts, travel router, etc I don&#8217;t bother carrying around in my backpack anymore. I hope these can get simpler and shorter every year. I tagged these with an affiliate ID for Amazon this year but mostly just to see if anyone actually buys stuff from these posts. I walk millions of steps a year with my backpack and wouldn&#8217;t carry something around unless I really believed in it, which is also why I&#8217;m always testing and trying new things. As you can tell a lot of this kit has evolved from recommendations, so if you have any please leave a note in the comments. I&#8217;ve also considered doing something similar for shoes, clothes, apps, suitcases, or toiletries, so holler if you&#8217;d like any of those. Alrighty, that&#8217;s it until next year!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 May 2017 17:05:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe to Halt Regular Ticket Sales May 31, Fewer than 400 Tickets Remain\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=70556\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-to-halt-regular-ticket-sales-may-31-fewer-than-400-tickets-remain\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2074:\"<p>WordCamp Europe organizers will be <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/05/22/wceu-regular-ticket-sales-to-end-on-may-31st\" target=\"_blank\">ending regular ticket sales on May 31</a>. The event has sold out well in advance in previous years, but the logistics of managing a budget for an estimated 3,000 attendees prompted organizers to opt for ending ticket sales two weeks before the event:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As WordCamp Europe is a community event, we have to be extra careful with every penny that’s spent.

Even on widescreen monitors, the Customizer sidebar is only 300px wide.</p>\n<p>This limitation was one of the motivating factors behind the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-pane-resizer/\">Customize Pane Resizer</a> feature plugin <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-feature-plugin-lets-users-resize-the-customizer-pane\">created in 2015</a>.

I use a 21 inch widescreen monitor and the width of the sidebar on my screen is 345px.</p>\n<img />345 Pixel Wide Customizer Sidebar\n<p>While not a huge change, the extra width is noticeable. WordPress theme and plugin developers who have built custom controls into the Customizer are highly encouraged to test WordPress 4.8 to ensure that they display properly on large screens.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Custom controls in plugins and themes should utilize alternative approaches to doing layout than using pixel widths,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Use of percentage-based widths or flexbox will help ensure that controls will <em>appear properly in larger displays</em>, while also making controls <em>future-compatible</em> when the sidebar width could be user-resizable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to be able to adjust the width of the sidebar, check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-pane-resizer\">Customize Pane Resizer</a> plugin.

The release has been more than five months in the making since planning began in early December 2016.</p>\n<p>Storefront 2.2.0 focuses on improving the new user experience. Getting all of the right widgets and design settings in place to set up a new store has been a challenge for users in the past. This release introduces a new setup and configuration wizard in the Cusotmizer that takes advantage of WordPress 4.7’s Starter Content feature. If the user is starting with a fresh store, the wizard will automatically import example products, create the homepage and set the correct template, assign the &#8216;full width&#8217; template to the cart and checkout pages, and remove unnecessary widgets.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/storefront-setup-wizard.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Storefront setup wizard in the Customozer\n<p>This release also brings an overall design refresh that includes a new homepage hero section. The Storefront development team replaced the theme&#8217;s previous dark header background with a white one in order to put the focus on product images and improve the appearance of site logos. This small but important change gives the theme an overall lighter look and will be important for child themes to account for in their styles.</p>\n<p>Storefront 2.2 also adds subtle changes to typography, font weights, and button styles for a more minimalist, less-opinionated base design.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/storefront-design-refresh.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Storefront design refresh\n<p>These changes are in line with what Matt Mullenweg said about Storefront when we interviewed him in December. He said Storefront was due for a design update and has a lot of potential for improvement.</p>\n<p>“With the Storefront theme there’s actually a lot we can do there to make it look like a really cool store out of the box, much like the default themes in WordPress,” Mullenweg said. “Part of the reason we change them every year is what was cool in 2012 is not cool in 2017. Fashions change, trends change. I think Woo should evolve Storefront in the same way. There’s kind of a look for independent stores right now. They’ve got a certain vibe. Let’s make it easy to do that vibe, so that you don’t have to be on Etsy or Amazon or one of the e-commerce monoliths to keep people coming to you and supporting your product.”</p>\n<p>Whereas many Storefront users had to opt for a child theme in order to have a more product-focused homepage in the past, the design and user experience improvements in the 2.2.0 release make the theme a more compelling option for use by itself.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 90,000 stores using Storefront</a> as a base for their sites WordPress.org lists eight child themes using Storefront as a parent and WooCommerce.com also has a directory of <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/\" target=\"_blank\">free and commercial child themes</a>. This major release will likely affect all stores using these themes in one way or another. To avoid any surprise design updates, the WooCommerce team recommends that users test version 2.2.0 in a development environment before updating.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 22 May 2017 20:13:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"Matt: Boarding Wrong Flight\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47325\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"https://ma.tt/2017/05/boarding-wrong-flight/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:567:\"<p>The Economist writes <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2017/05/where-am-i?fsrc=gnews\">about who&#8217;s wrong when flyers end up in the wrong cities</a>.

IBM markets software and services for what it calls “the anytime, anywhere workforce,” and its researchers have published numerous studies on the merits of remote work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If &#8220;IBM has boasted that more than 40% of employees worked outside traditional company offices&#8221; and they currently have 380,000 employees (wow), then that&#8217;s 152k people on the market.</p>\n<p>As I said when Yahoo did the same, it&#8217;s hard to judge this from the outside. A company that was happy about how they&#8217;re doing wouldn&#8217;t make a shift this big or this suddenly. It&#8217;s very possible the way distributed folks were interacting with their in-office teams wasn&#8217;t satisfactory, especially if they were forced to use subpar in-house tools like SameTime instead of Zoom or Skype. Yahoo didn&#8217;t have the best trajectory after they made a similar move, and hopefully IBM isn&#8217;t going to follow the same path.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Automattic and <a href=\"https://zapier.com/blog/companies-hiring-remote-workers/\">many other companies</a> are hiring. If you aren&#8217;t going to work in a company&#8217;s headquarters, it is probably safest to work at a company that is fully distributed (no second tier for people not at HQ) rather than be one of a few &#8220;remote&#8221; people at a centralized company.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 20 May 2017 19:21:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"Post Status: WordPress in higher education, with Rachel Cherry — Draft Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=37073\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-education-rachel-cherry-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2465:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

According to the rejections attendees have received, France is denying the visas because the ticket price for the conference is too low:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It has come to our attention that our friends from some countries are having problems with their Visas being rejected on the ground that “a 40€ entry fee cannot justify international travel”, something that makes this conference accessible to all. We are sad this is happening because now — for the first time in WordCamp Europe history — our inclusiveness is a burden we are carrying.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The open letter explains the WordCamp tradition of keeping ticket prices low to make it more inclusive for all income levels.</p>\n<p>WCEU Communications Lead Emanuel Blagonic estimates that five people from India that have already been denied visas but said more attendees and contributors will be taking their interviews in the coming days.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t write it to get an official response, as it is an open letter, but we hope to send the message about the importance of being inclusive and accessible – what WordCamps are, mainly because of the small ticket price,&#8221; Blagonic said. &#8220;We hope this letter will help officials understand that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the innocuous nature of WordCamps, obtaining visas to attend these events is a perennial struggle for attendees coming from nations that have strained relations, security concerns, or other issues with the host country. Petya Raykovska, who helped organize last year&#8217;s WordCamp Europe in Vienna, said that Pakistan was the country from which the most people were declined visas. This year she has already seen several members of the Polyglots contributor team denied visas for the community summit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Both the WCEU and WCUS teams go above and beyond to help people get to the camp,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;The WCEU team has been doing that for years, writing invitation letters in formats required by the embassies for each of the different countries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the letters don&#8217;t always make enough of an impact. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chiragpatel/\" target=\"_blank\">Chirag Patel</a>, a core contributor and editor of the Gujarati translation, was denied a visa coming from India. He expressed disappointment and said he hates the visa process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am a volunteer and was selected for the WCEU Summit as well but I am not able to get a visa,&#8221; Patel said. &#8220;It is so frustrating.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Patel is re-applying with a new invitation letter and WordCamp contact details, but cannot make his travel arrangements until he is approved. This has resulted in a significantly higher cost for the trip. Patel said if it were not for his company supporting him, he would not be able to afford the increase in cost.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rarst.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrey Savchenko</a>, a WordPress contributor living in Ukraine, is no stranger to visa denial but is fortunate to have a five year visa to the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen_en\" target=\"_blank\">Shengen area</a> to attend WCEU this year. When attending WCEU in Seville in 2015, his invitation from the organizers was lost twice in the mail and he received a visa a mere five days before the event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That added around $400 to the cost of my flights,&#8221; Savchenko said. &#8220;Also, due to the short term visa, I could not even fly home from Seville. I had to take the train to Madrid and fly from there, to be out of country before my visa expired the day after the WordCamp.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Savchenko was denied a visa to the U.S. for the first community summit in 2012. He described the interview in a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.rarst.net/thoughts/world-with-borders/\" target=\"_blank\">The world with borders</a>:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>My thin folder stays closed through all of it. My home, the one location in the world I care deeply about, is nothing. My savings, which fuel slim hope I will be able to live in a way different from paycheck-to-paycheck one day, are of no interest &#8211; all are disposable and meaningless on their scale against the chance of me “escaping” to their country.</p>\n<p>I get back my passport and a boilerplate response letter from thick pile of printouts. It thoroughly explains that I failed to display considerable attachments and am thus guilty of trying to sneak into and stay in United States illegally by default. I feel curiously powerless &#8211; no loopholes to find, no leverage to apply, no help to call for, no proof that matters.</p>\n<p>They spend ten minutes of their time (split about evenly between security, taking my fingerprints and interview itself) for which they charge $170. The following evening I spend much longer on Twitter, telling many people I won’t meet them and accepting their bitter disappointment.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lead organizer Paolo Belcastro said the team has received approximately 60 requests for invitation letters, which accounts for roughly 2% of expected attendees. Although there have been only a handful of visa denials so far, many have yet to interview. Belcastro said the team penned the letter based on the feedback of a few while they still have a chance to help them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the worst about [the interview process] is how helpless it makes you feel,&#8221; Savchenko said. &#8220;Someone gets to make a judgement about you as a person and you get to pay to be called untrustworthy and unwelcome.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For WordCamp attendees who have never had to jump through the hoops of a visa application, it&#8217;s important to remember that events held in major U.S. or European cities will always be missing the faces of valuable contributors who were unable to obtain a visa. Situations like these underscore the reality that virtual, online events, while lacking in much of the excitement and interpersonal connection, are by far the most inclusive way to gather and pass on information.</p>\n<p>WCEU organizers said they hope the President of France can help &#8220;unblock the situation&#8221; for the remaining attendees who are still going through the visa application process. Belcastro said the chances of the open letter being read by anyone with the power of changing anything are small, especially since the French government went through a major change last week.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to note that we have no wish to ask for any special treatment,&#8221; Belcastro said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about asking for automatic approval of visas for our attendees, as there are many other criteria involved that we totally respect.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our wish is to underline that the value of a conference can&#8217;t be measured by the price of its entry ticket &#8211; the same way the value of WordPress can&#8217;t be measured by its price tag.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 May 2017 20:06:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Matt: Candy Diet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47331\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"https://ma.tt/2017/05/candy-diet/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:713:\"<blockquote><p>The bestselling novel of 1961 was Allen Drury&#8217;s <em>Advise and Consent</em>.

The videos were created <a href=\"https://design.blog/2017/05/18/how-a-detroit-hackathon-turned-into-wordpress-coms-first-ever-tv-spots/\">earlier this year</a> when a volunteer team of Automatticians visited Detroit, MI, to participate in the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/eshachhabra/2015/03/31/8-innovative-urban-solutions-from-knight-cities-challenge/#6e5a96864d95\">Rebrand Detroit</a> project.</p>\n<p>Working with <a href=\"http://hajjflemings.com/\">Hajj Flemings</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://brandcamp.design/\">Brand Camp University</a>, the team helped launch new sites for nine small businesses over a 48 hour period. The sites that were launched include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://artinmotiondet.com/\">Art in Motion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://brixdetroit.com\">Brix Wine and Charcuterie Boutique</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://laposadadetroit.com/\">La Posada</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redbagdetroit.com/\">Red Bag Boutique</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://elsalpicondetroit.com\">El Salpicon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://royalfreshmarketdetroit.com/\">Royal Fresh Market</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mamacoosboutique.com\">Mama Coo’s Boutique</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thegardenbugdetroit.com\">The Garden Bug</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://justjavahouse.com/\">Motor City Java House</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The commercials are part of a series called &#8216;Free to be&#8217; where business owners share what success means to them and the city of Detroit.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrap\"></div>\n<p>Each video displays a WordPress logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen with occasional factoids highlighted across the center. The commercials end with the WordPress logo displayed in the center with the words, Websites, Blogs, and Domains underneath.</p>\n<img />WordPress.com Commercial Ending\n<h2>The Message in the Commercials Is Unclear</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve watched each commercial a few times and my initial reaction is confusion. I don&#8217;t know exactly what WordPress.com is trying to sell me. It&#8217;s obvious that these people are seeing success with hosting their sites on WordPress.com. But is it because of the tools available or is it because the VIP team or other staff members stepped in and guided them through the process?</p>\n<p>Unlike Squarespace&#8217;s commercials that showcase the product front and center, these commercials don&#8217;t show any of the capabilities of WordPress.com. In one of the videos, the text, &#8220;Customizable websites that can change with the times&#8221; is displayed. Instead of showing the business owners changing the look of their site with the Customizer, the commercial ends.</p>\n<img />Customizable With The Times\n<p>In a different video, WordPress&#8217; total market share is used as a selling point. Using this datapoint in a commercial geared towards WordPress.com is unsettling. Eric Mann, a long time WordPress developer, <a href=\"https://ttmm.io/tech/wordpress-com-not-wordpress/\">feels the same way</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have no problem with WordPress.com advertisements on TV or the Radio or elsewhere. They’re great ways for Automattic to build recognition of their product and encourage new signups.</p>\n<p>I <em>do</em> have a problem with advertisements conflating WordPress and WordPress.com by subtly suggesting that the &#8216;27% of the Internet run on WordPress&#8217; is due to Automattic or is somehow <em>because</em> of WordPress.com.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A majority of the 27% or now 28% of the web, according to <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all\">W3Techs</a>, uses self-hosted WordPress, not WordPress.com.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress and WordPress.com have a symbiotic relationship. Getting into semantics may seem like nitpicking but it&#8217;s important to distinguish that they are not the same thing.</p>\n<p>The marketing material used in the screenshot above conflates them. Examples like this don&#8217;t do anything to alleviate the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/resources/wordpress-versus-automattic/\">confusion that exists</a> between WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress.</p>\n<p>I realize I&#8217;m not the target market for these ads but they leave me with more questions than answers. Squarespace commercials intrigue me to the point of wanting to check out what the service has to offer. Meanwhile, I don&#8217;t have any emotional reaction after watching the WordPress.com commercials.</p>\n<p>In the future, I&#8217;d like to see a commercial that highlights the tools available on WordPress.com and shows a human using them to quickly edit and change their sites. This is something I think a lot of people can relate to instead of reading text that explains what the service&#8217;s capabilities are.</p>\n<p>If you were tasked with producing a commercial for WordPress.com, how would you showcase the best of what the service has to offer? Let us know what you think of the commercials in the comments.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 May 2017 07:10:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Primary Vagrant 4.0 Updated to Use PHP 7.1, Introduces a Site Generator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=70287\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://wptavern.com/primary-vagrant-4-0-updated-to-use-php-7-1-introduces-a-site-generator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5094:\"<p>In 2014, <a href=\"https://chriswiegman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Wiegman</a> forked VVV to create <a href=\"https://github.com/ChrisWiegman/Primary-Vagrant\" target=\"_blank\">Primary Vagrant</a>, an Apache based Vagrant configuration that uses <a href=\"https://puppetlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Puppet</a>. The project has steadily evolved over the past three years and the latest release includes significant changes that require users to destroy any existing environments before upgrading.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chriswiegman.com/2017/05/primary-vagrant-4-0/\" target=\"_blank\">Primary Vagrant 4.0</a> runs on PHP 7.1 by default. It also introduces a <a href=\"https://github.com/ChrisWiegman/Primary-Vagrant/wiki/Adding-a-Project\" target=\"_blank\">site generator</a> that makes it easy to create and manage new sites. The project has incorporated <a href=\"https://github.com/vagrant-landrush/landrush\" target=\"_blank\">Landrush</a>, a Vagrant plugin that provides a simple DNS server without users having to edit their hosts file.</p>\n<p>Wiegman said the direction for the release came from a combination of user feedback as well as features and fixes incorporated back from a fork of Primary Vagrant that he uses at his day job as a WordPress/Web Developer at UF Health at University of Florida. He and four other colleagues use it daily, which has helped him continually improve the project. Version 4.0 was released alongside a new extensive <a href=\"https://github.com/ChrisWiegman/Primary-Vagrant/wiki\" target=\"_blank\">Wiki</a> which Wiegman created to make it easier for his team at work.</p>\n<p>Switching between PHP versions is not yet as easy as Wiegman would like it to be. It can be done but he doesn&#8217;t recommend it. He is considering moving the project to use Docker in the future but will be sticking with Vagrant for the time being.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most Docker configs I see are really done the same way as Vagrant boxes simply swapping Docker for Vagrant,&#8221; Wiegman said. &#8220;I’ve debated moving this project to Docker but it would be done to allow more flexibility (swap nginx/mysql, php versions, etc). So far I’ve been more interested in making this as complete as possible for what I need it to do and I think with 4.0 it’s finally there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wiegman has been considering abandoning Vagrant for Docker for more than six months. In a November 2016 post titled <a href=\"https://chriswiegman.com/2016/11/vagrant-not-answer-everyone/\" target=\"_blank\">Vagrant Is Not the Answer for Everyone</a>, he identified a few of its shortcomings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After working with Vagrant for nearly three years. and even writing a post on how great it is, I can now say without hesitation that it is not the solution I thought it was,&#8221; Wiegman said. &#8220;I don’t say that lightly either as I’m about to launch version 4.0 of my Primary Vagrant project. Instead I say it based on the expectations we have put on it as a development community combined with the ecosystem (or lack thereof) of the tools we have been using to attempt to bend it to our will.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vagrant&#8217;s lack of flexibility for configuring software versions along with the lack of good interfaces to modify things like virtual host configurations have caused Weigman to take a second look at other solutions. Although Vagrant solves many issues for those who need to reproduce a development environment, dealing with the frustrating fragility of its maintenance requirements can sometimes be a major time sink.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The need for a good Vagrant box to install and configure the various pieces that make it all work means it doesn’t take much for something to fail resulting in, at best, an error message that requires another provision and, at worst, lost hours spent attempting to solve the issue in the tool that is supposed to help you build your product,&#8221; Wiegman said.</p>\n<p>The engineering team at 10up, creators of VVV, have also recognized some of the major drawbacks of using VVV, Vagrant, and Virtual Box/Hyper-V. They have recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/10up-releases-wp-docker-an-open-source-docker-configuration-for-local-wordpress-development\" target=\"_blank\">released WP Docker</a> as a faster, more lightweight alternative. Although the company still uses VVV in some instances, its development teams are free to choose the best solution for their projects.</p>\n<p>For Primary Vagrant&#8217;s upcoming 5.0 release, Wiegman is considering using Puppet 4 or replacing it with a new provisioning solution. He is also carefully examining a move to Docker and is experimenting to decide what will be best. Moving to Docker would offer the ability to treat PHP, MySQL, Apache, and other services more like a module that could be easily replaced, allowing for greater customization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I went Docker it might become Primary Docker and Primary Vagrant might be put up for adoption,&#8221; Wiegman said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not really sure yet, as that’s a pretty major change.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 May 2017 04:26:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Matt: One Million Words\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47339\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://ma.tt/2017/05/one-million-words/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:297:\"<p>My colleague Sara <a href=\"https://whenihavetime.com/2017/05/18/a-million-words-published-at-work-in-a-remote-company/\">has reached one million words posted to our internal sites</a>, and has some tips for distributed work and communication.

Building the application on Electron also enables the product&#8217;s development team to move its existing desktop apps to a shared codebase, as outlined on the <a href=\"https://githubengineering.com/how-four-native-developers-wrote-an-electron-app/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Engineering blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>From the start, GitHub Desktop for macOS and Windows were two distinct products, each with their own team. We worked in two separate tech stacks using two different skill sets. To maintain parity across the codebases, we had to implement and design the same features twice. If we ever wanted to add Linux support, we’d have to do it all a third time. All this meant we had twice the work, twice the bugs, and far less time to build new features. As it turns out, building native apps for multiple platforms doesn’t scale.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rewriting the desktop client on Electron allows GitHub to provide a unified cross-platform experience while reducing development time for the product. The beta app is open source and is <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">available for download</a> for users who want the newest desktop features before they are officially released.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 May 2017 03:31:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 273 – Mental Health Awareness With Bridget Willard and Ed Finkler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=70259&preview=true&preview_id=70259\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-273-mental-health-awareness-with-bridget-willard-and-ed-finkler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2943:\"<p>The month of May is <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/may\">Mental Health Awareness</a> month.

As of this morning, there were fewer than 50 spots remaining. <a href=\"http://wceurope.polldaddy.com/s/sign-up-for-contributor-day-2017\" target=\"_blank\">Contributor Day signup</a> is separate from the WordCamp registration and is still open for the last few available tickets.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 May 2017 19:30:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"HeroPress: Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1842\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:144:\"https://heropress.com/essays/community-saved-life-falling-lifted/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=community-saved-life-falling-lifted\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9265:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/051717-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: It is through helping others that I am helping myself every day... #mentalhealth\" /><blockquote><p>“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”<br />\n― Margaret Mead</p></blockquote>\n<p>This essay took me a long time to end; mainly because, in many ways, I am still writing it. My first essay for HeroPress was two years ago (&#8220;<a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/w-w-waiting-for-the-right-circumstances/\">W-W-Waiting For The Right Circumstances</a>&#8220;), June 2015; an essay written at a time in which I was at my Zenith.</p>\n<p>It was a story written by a young man full of hope, dreams, and accomplishment. A young man peaking in his career and his relationships. A young man who still had a long way to learn in this world; especially about himself and what true community meant. This essay, the one you are reading now, is from rock bottom.</p>\n<h3>The Great Depression</h3>\n<p>People, mostly those who do not have depression, think of depression as a severe sadness; it is not sadness. Sadness can be felt. Depression is more of a vacuous endurance of life; each moment folding aimlessly into the next. Sadness would be a relief in comparison.</p>\n<p>I have had depression many times in my life prior to the one I am about to tell you about; previously I had managed to endure through it, this time was different and this time I needed help. I, unsurprisingly to me, was diagnosed with (aptly named) &#8216;manic depression&#8217;. This explained my amazing highs, my deepest lows, and the plateau of the in-between.</p>\n<p>What did this mean for me? I didn&#8217;t know, I was still me. Nothing about me had changed other than learning a new label that I had to bare. I was still me. I was still me.</p>\n<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in <a href=\"http://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/\">2001</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;One in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was one in that four people; a large number, yet I felt alone.</p>\n<p>Alone because there is so much stigma attached to having a Mental Wellness issue that we barely talk about it, its almost taboo. We are a society more comfortable with having a broken leg than to tell our bosses, colleagues, friends or peers that we are depressed.</p>\n<p>That needed to change.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Closet</h3>\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, I stood in-front of an audience and came out of the figurative closet with my presentation of: &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>&#8221;</p>\n<p>After that talk, many people came out of their own closets to me and thanked me for being so &#8216;brave&#8217; as to talk so openly about a subject so few understood much about. My hope with that talk, with this essay, that an act of openness like this is no longer seen as &#8216;being brave&#8217; but being normal, being understood. It was the &#8216;bravery&#8217; of people like Cory Miller and Rich Robinkoff that allowed me to be brave in telling my own story.</p>\n<p>That was September 2016. In February 2017, I reached my darkest hour when I attempted to take my own life.</p>\n<h3>A New Beginning</h3>\n<p>In many ways, this is my WordPress re-origin story.</p>\n<p>After surviving my own actions, it was the WordPress community that were there to support me. It was my friends I had made in the local WordPress community, and when I opened up about my experience, the international WordPress Community came to help me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are so many people in the WordPress Community who I owe a huge debt to. People who genuinely reached out and cared about the response I gave when asked, &#8216;How are you?&#8217;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was in this moment of realizing I had the WordPress Community that I began to live again; the WordPress community saved my life. It was in this moment that I realized that if I knew I could have this support sooner, I may not have gone as far as I had gone. It was in this moment that I vowed to be blatantly honest with the world so that no one else may ever feel that they are that alone again.</p>\n<p>Is there any other software specific community that can make the claim of being so caring as to have helped someone stay alive? I do not know the answer to that question, but I do know that WordPress and its community has definitely done that for me.</p>\n<h3>WPHugs: Giving back to community</h3>\n<p>I openly wrote about my experiences.</p>\n<p>I even mention it straight up in Job Interviews, and I do believe that this, knowingly or unknowingly, has costed me various positions I could have easily received had there not been any mention of a mental illness and my recent events &#8211; and its understandable.</p>\n<p>How would you react when you ask a candidate about why he left his previous employment, and he answers: &#8220;I am manic depressive, I went a few months off my meds, I did not understand it enough at the time, and then tried to take my own life and later moved cities to be closer to family and friends&#8221;? When all I could have said was I moved cities to be closer to family, with a smile that couldn&#8217;t be argued with.</p>\n<p>I started an initiative called <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/\">WPHugs</a>, a passion project hugely inspired by HeroPress, which is designed to be a safe space in the WordPress Community where topics of Mental Health, and general well-being and life balance can be freely and non-judgmentally spoken about, with care and compassion offered by all. This reminds me, we should have a creed, all great communities have one.</p>\n<p>It is simply fortunate timing that <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/\">WPHugs.org</a> and this essay are launched and written in Mental Health Awareness Month. Some may even go as far as calling it serendipity; a word I have tattooed in Braille on my wrists.</p>\n<p>It is through helping others that I am helping myself, everyday&#8230;</p>\n<h3>In conclusion-ipsum</h3>\n<p>My story is not unique &#8211; it is simply one that is told.</p>\n<p>In speaking out about Mental Wellness and the huge role our community plays in its stigma, I hope that someone, somewhere, also gets &#8216;brave enough&#8217; to speak up and reach out.</p>\n<p>I have no conclusion to this essay&#8230; I continue, everyday, to write it; and I hope you do too.</p>\n<p>The WordPress community doesn&#8217;t just power a percentage of the internet; It empowers too.</p>\n<p>P.S. Talking about it will only become easier by talking about it, so please, continue the conversation; lets more of us talk and keep talking.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Community%20saved%20my%20life%3A%20Falling%20down%2C%20lifted%20up.&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcommunity-saved-life-falling-lifted%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcommunity-saved-life-falling-lifted%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcommunity-saved-life-falling-lifted%2F&title=Community+saved+my+life%3A+Falling+down%2C+lifted+up.\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/community-saved-life-falling-lifted/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/051717-150x150.jpg&description=Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/community-saved-life-falling-lifted/\" title=\"Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/community-saved-life-falling-lifted/\">Community saved my life: Falling down, lifted up.</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 May 2017 12:00:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Leo Gopal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Matt: New TV Ads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47336\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"https://ma.tt/2017/05/new-tv-ads/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:416:\"<p></p>\n<p>As I mentioned in the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/12/state-of-the-word-2016/\">State of the Word</a> this is the year we&#8217;re ramping up marketing.

If you manage multiple sites, you may have seen automatic update notices landing in your inbox this evening. The security release is for all previous versions and WordPress is recommending an immediate update. Sites running versions older than 3.7 will require a manual update.</p>\n<p>The vulnerabilities patched in 4.7.5 were responsibly disclosed to the WordPress security team by five different parties credited in the release post. These include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insufficient redirect validation in the HTTP class</li>\n<li>Improper handling of post meta data values in the XML-RPC API</li>\n<li>Lack of capability checks for post meta data in the XML-RPC API</li>\n<li>A Cross Site Request Forgery (CRSF)  vulnerability was discovered in the filesystem credentials dialog</li>\n<li>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered when attempting to upload very large files</li>\n<li>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered related to the Customizer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several of the vulnerability reports came from security researchers on HackerOne. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.hackerone.com/blog/Q-and-A-with-Wordpress-security-team-lead-aaron-campbell\" target=\"_blank\">interview with HackerOne</a>, WordPress Security Team Lead Aaron Campbell said the team has had a spike in reports since <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-is-now-on-hackerone-launches-bug-bounties\" target=\"_blank\">publicly launching its bug bounty program</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The increase in volume of reports was drastic as expected, but also our team really hadn’t had to process any invalid reports before moving the program public,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;The dynamics of the Hacker Reputation system really came into play for the first time, and it was really interesting to figure out how to best work within it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If WordPress continues to sustain the same volume of reports on its new HackerOne account, users may see more frequent security releases in the future.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.7.5 also includes a handful of maintenance fixes.

Adding video, audio, or images to text widgets typically involves using custom HTML.</p>\n<p>Each of the new widgets in 4.8 takes advantage of the WordPress Media Library. Because the widgets use the media modal, users can insert content from a URL. This is particularly convenient for the Video widget as most videos are not stored locally.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/what-to-expect-in-wordpress-4-8/corevideowidget\"><img width=\"341\" height=\"454\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CoreVideoWidget.png?fit=341%2C454&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/what-to-expect-in-wordpress-4-8/coreaudiowidget\"><img width=\"341\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CoreAudioWidget.png?fit=341%2C251&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/what-to-expect-in-wordpress-4-8/coreimagewidget\"><img width=\"341\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CoreImageWidget.png?fit=341%2C360&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Core Image Widget\" /></a>\n\n<p>Here is what the core widgets look like on Twenty Seventeen after they&#8217;ve been configured.</p>\n<img />Core Widgets on The Frontend\n<p>The text widget now has a visual editor with a couple of basic formatting tools available. The visual editor supports Keyboard shortcuts. However, it does not support <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds\">oEmbed</a>. Like the post editor, you can switch between Visual and HTML mode.

The plugin provides a WordPress hook/API reference for developers and displays the actions and filters that fired as the page loaded. At launch Sanford was fairly committed to the Hookr brand, despite criticism, due to an oversaturated market for WordPress developer plugins. After 3,500 downloads, Sanford decided to rebrand and put the plugin in the official directory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on the usage and positive feedback, I wanted to target a broader audience, which led to both the re-brand and submission to the WordPress Plugin repository,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;Leveraging the plugin repo, it will be much easier to coordinate/communicate updates, which is somewhat lacking today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 1.0.0 release of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-inspect/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Inspect</a> includes mostly bug fixes and technical debt cleanup with two major enhancements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WP Inspect will only be active under specific roles, with Administrators being enabled by default. (Previously it was active for everyone.)</li>\n<li>Action detail now requires no additional clicks. (Before, if users wanted to inspect an action, they would have to click the action name.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sanford said WP Inspect will be migrating to a module-based architecture that will allow users to create their own tooling. He is also planning to release several commercial modules that will expand the debugging capabilities of the plugin. He said he doesn&#8217;t anticipate the type of demand or usage that would warrant a marketplace for third-party modules, but he&#8217;s open to the idea.</p>\n<p>With the plugin now rebranded and released, Sandford is using his time to create the infrastructure to offer Hookr as a SaaS product for commercial theme and plugin developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Depending on membership level, users can interface with HookrAPI to get additional details for debugging,&#8221; Sandford said. &#8220;Users may submit their current codebase for &#8216;comment coverage&#8217; analysis, which is great for determining the quantity and quality of inline code documentation. Finally, users may submit their projects to HookrAPI for real time code parsing and documentation to be included with their commercial theme or plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hookr-api-e1494965787732.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Sanford plans to launch a sister site to the online <a href=\"http://hookr.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Hookr.io</a> reference, under another &#8220;G-rated&#8221; name with a simplified interface, as well as an offline version of Hookr.

The plaintiff, <a href=\"http://artifex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Artifex Software Inc.</a>, is the creator of <a href=\"http://artifex.com/products-ghostscript-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Ghostscript</a>, an AGPL-licensed PDF interpreter. In 2016, the company filed a lawsuit against <a href=\"http://hancom.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hancom</a>, a South Korean software company that incorporated Ghostscript into its Hangul word processing software without complying with the GPL.</p>\n<p>Ghostscript is available for free for those who use it in compliance with its AGPL license. Artifex also offers a <a href=\"http://artifex.com/licensing/\" target=\"_blank\">commercial license of Ghostscript</a> that is required if the user is including it and distributing it within an application that is not licensed under the AGPL. Richard Stallman outlined this common practice of <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/selling-exceptions\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;selling exceptions&#8221; to the GPL</a> in 2010, saying that he has considered it acceptable since the 1990&#8217;s, because &#8220;this approach has made it possible for important programs to become free software.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2016cv06982/305835/32\" target=\"_blank\">complaint</a>, Hancom failed to purchase a commercial license and also did not distribute the source code as required by the AGPL:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Because Defendant did not have a commercial license for Ghostscript, its use and distribution of Ghostscript constituted consent to the terms of the GNU GPL&#8230;In addition, Defendant’s website stated that it had licensed Ghostscript under the GNU GPL. Nonetheless, Defendant failed to comply with key provisions of the GNU GPL. In particular, because Defendant integrated Ghostscript into its software without revealing to the end-user that Ghostscript was part of the Hancom software, the GNU GPL required Defendant to distribute its software with the accompanying source code. Defendant did not do so and thus violated the GNU GPL, terminating Defendant’s license to use Ghostscript. Defendant’s failure to obtain a commercial license deprived Plaintiff of a licensing fee, or, alternatively, its failure to comply with the GNU GPL deprived Plaintiff of the opportunity “to further promote the advancement of interpreter technologies.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although Hancom is said to have removed Ghostscript from its software in August 2016, Artifex is asking for a court order for Hancom to stop the infringement and seeks compensation for damages. Artifex also requests that the court require Hancom to distribute to each licensee of Hangul and Hancom Office the complete source code for the products in accordance with the GPL.</p>\n<p>Hancom responded by filing a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Artifex had not demonstrated the existence of a contract, how it was breached, or the damages caused by a breach.</p>\n<p>An order issued by Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ruled that Artifex has sufficiently established the existence of a contract:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The GNU GPL, which is attached to the complaint, provides that the Ghostscript user agrees to its terms if the user does not obtain a commercial license. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant used Ghostscript, did not obtain a commercial license, and represented publicly that its use of Ghostscript was licensed under the GNL GPU. These allegations sufficiently plead the existence of a contract.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, the ruling also recognized the damage that results from a company failing to comply with an open source license, citing the 2008 ruling on Jacobsen v. Katzer, another open source licensing dispute:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Indeed, as the Federal Circuit has recognized, there is harm which flows from a party’s failure to comply with open source licensing: “[t]he lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration” because “[t]here are substantial benefits, including economic benefits, to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties.” Jacobsen v. Katzer, 535 F.3d 1373, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although QZ.com and other media outlets are reporting that this is a groundbreaking ruling that <a href=\"https://qz.com/981029/a-federal-court-has-ruled-that-an-open-source-license-is-an-enforceable-contract/\" target=\"_blank\">makes open source licenses an enforceable contract</a>, the case has not yet gone to trial. The court has simply denied Hancom&#8217;s arguments that because the company didn&#8217;t sign anything, the GPL does not constitute a contract. The ruling states that Artifex&#8217;s allegations regarding the dual licensing structure for its product are enough for the company to begin the process of pleading damages for its claim that Hancom breached its contract. It is not a ruling about whether or not copyleft licenses are enforceable.</p>\n<p>Artifex is now free to pursue its case of breach of contract and copyright infringement claims against Hancom, but it&#8217;s still very early and may end in a settlement. Hancom is ordered to file its answer by May 18 and both parties are scheduled to appear for an Initial Case Management Conference on June 15.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 May 2017 19:09:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:115:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Experiments With Allowing Business Plan Customers to Install Third-Party Plugins and Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=70129\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-experiments-with-allowing-business-plan-customers-to-install-third-party-plugins-and-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2521:\"<p>One of the most important things that distinguishes self-hosted WordPress from WordPress.com is the ability to install custom themes and plugins.

This is a private site where SSNC members can read and publish internal news about the organisation, take part in forum discussions, and join or create groups to help them organise their work. Members of SSNC can create WordPress user accounts using their membership numbers from the organization&#8217;s CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Naturkontakt has been around since the 90’s, powered by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FirstClass\">FirstClass</a>. By 2010, that platform had become outdated and its market share was declining. This led some members to write proposals to find a new platform. Their goal was to select a platform which would serve as a hub for all the different aspects of SSNC’s mission and vision. These include &#8220;spreading knowledge, charting environmental threats, proposing solutions, and influencing politicians and authorities, both nationally and internationally. Under democratic forms, we work regionally in 24 county branches and locally in 270 community branches.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Moving to WordPress</h2>\n<p>In 2011, SSNC acted on their decision to set up a new web-based platform for internal communications and contacted us at <a href=\"https://www.klandestino.se/\">Klandestino</a> to work on this project. After evaluating different platforms, we chose WordPress. Some deciding factors include WordPress&#8217; open source licensing, our experience working with the platform, and the plethora of different plugins that extended WordPress to make it suitable for online communities.</p>\n<p>The first iteration of the new Naturkontakt site was launched in 2011, powered by WordPress and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-symposium-pro/\">WP Symposium</a>. This was quite a while ago but as I recall (plus email logs), the choice stood between BuddyPress and WP Symposium. At that time, WP Symposium already had a forums component while BuddyPress lacked a solid forum integration. Remember that this was the time of the stand-alone bbPress forums which took a tortuous and unstable route to integrate to both WordPress and BuddyPress.</p>\n<h2>bbPress 2.0 to the Rescue</h2>\n<p>A year after we launched the new site, we undertook an evaluation which revealed some pain points. To name a few, WP Symposium had limited extensibility, some security issues, and major problems with performance. With those challenges in mind, we researched again into other community solutions for WordPress. By that time, the <a href=\"https://bbpress.org/blog/2011/09/bbpress-2-0-now-available/\">new bbPress 2.0 plugin was available</a> and it worked very well with BuddyPress.</p>\n<p>It was an easy decision to switch from WP Symposium to BuddyPress and bbPress. The major tasks were the arduous migration of data and continuous testing. This new set up has stood the test of time, we&#8217;re really pleased with it. The BuddyPress-bbPress combination gave us a running start with forums, groups, profiles, and messages, which are some of the required pieces of functionality needed on Naturkontakt.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/profile-forums-page.png\" alt=\"Profile page\" width=\"1668\" height=\"785\" class=\"size-full wp-image-265954\" /></p>\n<p>Further development of Naturkontakt 2.0 led to the introduction of multisite features to the community. Fortunately, BuddyPress works very well in a multisite environment. Each local organisation (group) of SSNC could have their own subsite to publish news.</p>\n<p>To make this work as smoothly as possible, we wrote custom plugins for the following functionalities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many-to-many relationships between groups and subsites. For example, the group coordinating work on forest issues could be connected to the subsite publishing news about forest issues.</li>\n<li>File archives for groups so that members can upload and version docs, PDFs, images, etc.</li>\n<li>Sitewide search, a plugin that indexes all content from the entire multisite network into a “ghost” site to make it possible to have a centralised search throughout the entire network and blog/archive pages that lists posts from all sites.</li>\n<li>A drag and drop front page workflow where the editors of the site can search for and list articles from all sites on the network on the main site front page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This second version of Naturkontakt was released in late 2012. Since then, the basic functionalities have remained more or less the same. The site did get a facelift a few years ago when we focused on making the site work better on phones and tablets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/blog-archive.png\" alt=\"Blog Archive\" width=\"1677\" height=\"920\" class=\"size-full wp-image-265955\" /></p>\n<h2>Going forward with PHP 7</h2>\n<p>Last year, after a month of capacity/speed problems, a new evaluation showed that some long-delayed upgrades had to be made. We started a new project to focus mainly on stability and speed improvements. We finished the project just right before this article was written.</p>\n<p>We implemented the following improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Combed through the codebases</strong>. We searched for deprecated functions and places where custom functionality could be replaced with newly added functionality from BuddyPress, WordPress, and bbPress. We decreased the number of active plugins by a third because of the new features that had been rolled into the above-mentioned projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Switched over to<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\"> Elasticsearch</a>/<a href=\"https://www.elasticpress.io/\">ElasticPress</a></strong>. Our custom sitewide search has served its purpose well. However, since it’s only been used on this platform its development has fallen behind. And compared to new technologies such as Elasticsearch it didn’t cut the mustard. By switching to Elasticsearch we have offloaded a lot of the most expensive queries currently done by WordPress to a server/platform that’s fine-tuned for that kind of work.</li>\n<li><strong>Upgraded to PHP 7</strong>. This was the last part of the project. We’ve seen major improvements in the response time from the server, on average about 50%-70% decrease in response times! That is, of course, very important on a dynamic site such as for any community where static page caching often isn’t an option.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our stats show the continued growth of the SSNC community, even though the competition from Facebook can be really hard. One of the major advantages of using WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress is that SSNC owns its own data.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are always things to improve on. When we completed the recent project to improve performance, despite limited budgets and time constraints, we were all satisfied and hopeful that the site will be around for many more years. We also expect that upcoming development work will be focused more on the user interaction elements of the site, hopefully by building upon and extending the great work that has gone into <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/next-template-packs\">BP Nouveau.</a> &lt;3</p>\n<p>To end on a personal note I’d like to thank all of the wonderful contributors to BuddyPress who have welcomed me into the community and helped me along with trac tickets and patches. Beyond my satisfaction with Naturkontakt and working with SSNC (whom I share a lot of political views with), and the functionality that BuddyPress has provided for the project, the best part of having worked on this site is that I also feel that I’ve become part of a community that tries to do something constructive about the unpleasant grip that Facebook has over our personal and professional lives.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/lakrisgubben.jpeg\" alt=\"lakrisgubben\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-265950\" /> <em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lakrisgubben\">Alexander Berthelsen</a> and his two colleagues are co-owners of the web development co-operative <a href=\"http://klandestino.se/\">Klandestino AB</a>.

planning a smaller WP release early next month, bringing in three major enhancements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An improved visual editor experience, with a new TinyMCE that allows you to navigate more intuitively in and out of inline elements like links. (Try it out to see, it&#8217;s hard to describe.)</li>\n<li>A revamp of the dashboard news widget to bring in nearby and upcoming events including meetups and WordCamps.</li>\n<li>Several new media widgets covering images, audio, and video, and an enhancement to the text widget to support visual editing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first beta of 4.8 is now available for testing. You can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">beta tester plugin</a> (or just run trunk) to try the latest and greatest, and each of these areas could use a ton of testing. Our goals are to make editing posts with links more intuitive, make widgets easier for new users and more convenient for existing ones, and get many more people aware of and attending our community events.</p>\n<p><em>Four point eight is here<br />\nSmall changes with a big punch<br />\nBig ones come later</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 May 2017 00:15:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Matt Mullenweg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 272 – Interview With James Farmer, Co-Founder and CEO of Incsub\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=70009&preview=true&preview_id=70009\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-272-interview-with-james-farmer-co-founder-and-ceo-of-incsub\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4563:\"<p>On this episode of WordPress Weekly, I&#8217;m joined by <a href=\"https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/author/james/\">James Farmer</a>, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://incsub.com/\">Incsub</a>. Farmer has been involved in the WordPress community for 11 years and in that time, he and I have butted heads, mildly speaking.</p>\n<p>Last year, Farmer <a href=\"https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/10-years-as-a-wordpress-entrepreneur/\">looked back</a> at the last 10 years of being a WordPress entrepreneur. In that post, he shares emails and conversations he has had in the WordPress community that are cringe-worthy. Because of the extremely poor interactions I&#8217;ve had with Farmer in the past, I&#8217;ve kept away from his work and the projects he is associated with.</p>\n<p>In the past few months, I&#8217;ve read interviews with Farmer where he appears to have turned over a new leaf. In an <a href=\"https://torquemag.io/2017/04/qa-wpmu-dev-ceo-james-farmer/\">interview on Torquemag</a> congratulating him on WPMU Dev&#8217;s Smush Image Compression plugin <a href=\"http://torquemag.io/2017/04/wp-smush-defeats-wordfence-wins-plugin-madness-2017/\">winning the Plugin Madness competition</a>, Farmer is asked what advice he would give to aspiring plugin developers?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Make the free version as brilliant as you possibly can. Give back to the community as much as you can and it’ll come back to you in spades,&#8221; Farmer said. &#8220;Contribute to the wordpress.org support forums and community, commit code if you can, speak at WordCamps, and be as helpful and useful as possible, it’ll ALL be worth it, I promise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked what&#8217;s the most important lesson he&#8217;s learned as CEO and co-founder of WPMU Dev, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>That is a very good question, and one I think I’m actually probably not able to answer as there are basically so so many important things.</p>\n<p>I think though if I had to pick one, it goes along the same lines as my last answer: the more you give out, the more you give of yourself and the more, kinda, selfless that you are… the more you get back. And, sadly (and from painful experience), the opposite is also true.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Because of the way he answered these questions and my curiosity for his career in WordPress, I invited him on WordPress Weekly. We talked about his entrepreneurial career and some of the failures along the way. He explains the genesis behind the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/\">Smush Image Optimization Plugin</a> and shares what it&#8217;s like to be part of the WordPress community in Australia.</p>\n<p>My favorite part of the interview is when Farmer describes his experience at WordCamp Europe a few years ago that fundamentally changed his perception of the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>After this interview, I can confidently say that the past between us is water under the bridge. I look forward to future conversations with Farmer and taking a closer look at his company&#8217;s products.</p>\n<h2>Stories Discussed:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/bbpress-2-6-beta-3-likely-as-team-focuses-on-solid-data-migration-path\">bbPress 2.6 Beta 3 Likely as Team Focuses on Solid Data Migration Path</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/versionpress-4-0-tentatively-scheduled-to-ship-in-september\">VersionPress 4.0 Tentatively Scheduled to Ship in September</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-release-targeted-for-june-8\">WordPress 4.8 Release Targeted for June 8</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wphugs-a-community-devoted-to-educating-discussing-and-raising-awareness-of-mental-health\">WPHugs: A Community Devoted to Educating, Discussing, and Raising Awareness of Mental Health</a></p>\n<h2>WPWeekly Meta:</h2>\n<p><strong>Next Episode:</strong> Wednesday, May 17th 3:00 P.M.

This version added new search capabilities, bulk undo, and a number of bug fixes. It was the first release since it became a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/versionpress-transitions-into-a-free-open-source-project\">free, open source project</a>.</p>\n<p>In a post on the <a href=\"https://blog.versionpress.net/2017/05/versionpress-4-0-update/\">project&#8217;s development blog</a>, Borek Bernard, co-founder of VersionPress, describes what the team is focusing on for 4.0 which includes a tentative release schedule.</p>\n<p>VersionPress 4.0 beta is planned to ship in June with 4.0-final scheduled to ship in September. In addition, the team will be labeling the project as a Developer Preview to better indicate its production-readiness.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With every major release, you rightfully ask about the status of the project when it comes to production-readiness,&#8221; Bernard said. &#8220;The answer is &#8216;your mileage may vary&#8217; but we feel we should better indicate that it’s only really intended for developers, currently. Therefore, we’ll be adding the ‘Developer Preview’ label for the project as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n<p>VersionPress 4.0 beta 1 will support Jetpack and WooCommerce via <a href=\"https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/master/docs/Plugin-Support.md\">plugin definitions</a>. Updates to internal data structures, compatibility fixes with WordPress 4.7, and other improvements are also slated to be in 4.0.</p>\n<p>Bernard also provides an outline of what to expect from the project in the near future. The team hopes to release Version 5.0 later this year or early next year with definitions for the most popular plugins. It will also be the first version rolled out on the project&#8217;s upcoming platform.

Since the beginning, I have been close to Udaipur. With the studies and growing up here, the thought of leaving this beautiful city have never occurred to me. Everything I have achieved in life could never have been possible without the support of my parents.</p>\n<p>The 6 months after the graduation have been the most troublesome. At the time it felt as if finding a job was a big challenge, but I never gave up. There is a saying that “No work is big or small. It’s not the stature of work that matters, but what you learn from working that counts” and that is when I started to look for a job out of my field of expertise. My life had a new turn and me, fortunately, got a job at KPO and that was a new beginning of my life.</p>\n<h3>How I got into WordPress</h3>\n<p>Before joining into IdeaBox I don&#8217;t know much about WordPress. Before knowing about WordPress my identity was just a beginner. By keep working on WordPress I got so much involvement in that. WordPress gave me a chance in my life to prove that I could do something different and I felt like I have the skills and potential and I could do something. I got my confidence back. I always try to learn something new in WordPress.</p>\n<p>I do theme development in WordPress. I have learned so much from WordPress. I can proudly say I am the part of WordPress community. One thing I got a chance to learn is in life, there is no shortcut for success. Whatever person get in life is only because of the hard work.</p>\n<p>I have completed 3 years in WordPress and I love to be a part of it. I love WordPress and it has the wonderful community. In my free time, I do WordPress translations. I try to contribute in every possible way by giving support, translating and any other things.</p>\n<h3>First Speaking Experience at WordCamp</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Udaipur got organized recently. In that, I was the organizer and speaker. It was the amazing experience which I never felt before. After WordCamp only I get to know that how big community it is. When I become the speaker of the WordPress is the most memorable and the greatest experience of my life. I will never forget this moment in my life.</p>\n<p>One thing is I was part of the organizing team and my first session. I was totally nervous. The session went so well and all nervousness went away in happiness. Because I realized that talking in front of these many people is not an easy task. So, I was very Happy. If I get a chance to perform In WordPress community, I will do my contribution in any way.</p>\n<h3>Thank you note</h3>\n<p>Thanks to WordPress for changing my life and I want to especially thank my parents for supporting and believe me always.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"hindi\">सफलता का कोई शॉर्टकट नहीं है</h1>\n<p>उदयपुर को झीलों के शहर के रूप में भी जाना जाता है, यह राजस्थान के खूबसूरत शहर में से एक है और यही वह जगह है जहाँ से मैं हूं। शुरुआत से ही मैं उदयपुर में रहने और पढ़ाई के साथ और यहां पले बड़े होने की वजह से इस खूबसूरत शहर को छोड़ने का विचार मुझे कभी नहीं आया। जीवन में जो कुछ भी हासिल किया है, वह मेरे माता-पिता के समर्थन के बिना कभी संभव नहीं हो सकता था।</p>\n<p>पढ़ाई पूरी होने के ६ महीने बाद तक सबसे ज्यादा परेशानी रही। समय के साथ ऐसा महसूस हुआ जैसे काम ढूंढना काम करने से ज्यादा कठिन था, लेकिन मैंने अपना मनोबल टूटने नहीं दिया और धैर्य से काम लिया। जैसा कि कहा जाता है &#8220;कोई काम बड़ा या छोटा नहीं है, किसी काम को करने से जो आप सीखते है वह मायने रखता है&#8221; और तब मैंने अपने विशेषज्ञता के क्षेत्र से हटकर नौकरी खोजना शुरू कर दिया। मेरी जिंदगी का एक नया मोड़ था और मुझे सौभाग्य से केपीओ में नौकरी मिली और यही वह जगह थी जहां मेरे जीवन की एक नई शुरुआत शुरू हुई।</p>\n<h3>कैसे मैंने WordPress को जाना</h3>\n<p>आइडियाबॉक्स में शामिल होने से पहले मुझे वर्डप्रेस के बारे में अधिक जानकारी नहीं थी। वर्डप्रेस के बारे में जानने से पहले मेरी पहचान सिर्फ एक प्रवर्तक के रूप में थी। वर्डप्रेस पर काम करते रहने से, मेरी इसमें सहभागिता बढ़ती गयी। वर्डप्रेस ने मुझे अपने जीवन में एक मौका दिया है ताकि साबित हो कि मैं कुछ अलग कर सकती हूं और मुझे लगा कि मेरे पास कौशल और क्षमता है और मैं कुछ कर सकती हूं। मुझे अपना आत्मविश्वास वापस मिल गया। मैं हमेशा वर्डप्रेस में कुछ नया सीखने की कोशिश करती हूं।</p>\n<p>मैं वर्डप्रेस में थीम डेवलपमेंट करती हूं। मैंने वर्डप्रेस में बहुत कुछ सीखा है। मैं गर्व से कह सकता हूं कि मैं वर्डप्रेस समुदाय का हिस्सा हूं। एक बात मुझे जीवन में जानने को मिली है कि सफलता के लिए कोई शॉर्टकट नहीं है। जो कुछ भी जीवन में मिलता है, कड़ी मेहनत के कारण ही मिलता है।</p>\n<p>मैंने वर्डप्रेस में 3 साल पूरे किए हैं और मैं इसका हिस्सा बनकर बेहद खुश हूं। मुझे वर्डप्रेस पसंद है और इसमें अद्भुत समुदाय है मेरे खाली समय में मैं वर्डप्रेस अनुवाद करती हूं। मैं वर्डप्रेस में समर्थन, अनुवाद और अन्य चीजें देने के हर संभव तरीके से योगदान करने की कोशिश करती हूं।</p>\n<h3>WordCamp में पहली बार वक्ता बनने का अनुभव</h3>\n<p>Wordcamp उदयपुर हाल ही में आयोजित किया गया। उसमें मैं आयोजक और स्पीकर थी यह अद्भुत अनुभव था जिसे मैंने पहले कभी महसूस नहीं किया था। वर्डकैंप में मुझे पता है कि यह कितना बड़ा समुदाय है। यह मेरे जीवन का सबसे यादगार और सबसे बड़ा अनुभव है। मैं इसे एक क्षण के लिए भी नहीं भूलूंगी।</p>\n<p>एक बात यह है कि मैं आयोजक टीम का हिस्सा थी और मेरा पहला सेशन। मैं पूरी तरह नर्वस थी। सेशन बहुत अच्छा गया और सभी घबराहट खुशी में बदल गई। क्योंकि मुझे एहसास हुआ कि इतने लोगों के सामने बात करना आसान बात नहीं थी। इसलिए मैं बहुत खुश थी। यदि मुझे वर्डप्रेस समुदाय में प्रदर्शन करने का मौका मिलता है तो मैं किसी भी तरह से योगदान करुँगी।</p>\n<h3>धन्यवाद पत्र</h3>\n<p>वर्डप्रेस के लिए धन्यवाद जिसने मुझे खुद को साबित करने का मौका दिया और मैं अपने माता-पिता के लिए विशेष रूप से धन्यवाद करना चाहती हूं कि उन्होंने हमेशा मुझ पर विश्वास किया और मुझे प्रोत्साहित किया।</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: There is No Shortcut to Success &#8211;

he said. &#8220;It kind of goes back to the old bbPress problem where WordPress.org is running 2.5 and is also running a hybrid of 2.6 to take advantage of performance improvements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Throughout the process of migrating WordPress.org from bbPress 2.5 to 2.6, the development team was able to resolve a number of bottlenecks associated with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/mattnote-from-wordcamp-san-francisco\">turning bbPress into a plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With every beta comes more feedback and the closer we get to release, the more feedback that comes in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As we upgrade WordPress.org and receive more feedback, we fix more things.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;With a small team, there&#8217;s no dedicated resources on the project which is the same problem that existed in 2014 when I did my <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/john-james-jacoby-launches-indiegogo-campaign-to-fund-buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress-development\">Indiegogo campaign</a>. I&#8217;m really trying to spend a lot of time working on it but I&#8217;m also spending a lot of time on the security team, contributing to WordPress core, Multisite, and other projects. bbPress is my focus for as much as I can afford it to be.</p>\n<p>&#8220;bbPress 2.6 will ship, I promise, and it will be a better bbPress than it has ever been.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jacoby confirmed that there will likely be a third beta released sometime in the near future. Those who have upgraded to bbPress 2.6 Beta 2 are <a href=\"https://bbpress.org/forums/topic/bbpress-2-6-beta/page/3/#post-183637\">reporting substantial performance improvements</a>.</p>\n<p>If you use bbPress 2.5 and want to upgrade to 2.6 Beta 2, Jacoby encourages users to create a full backup of the site&#8217;s database as the upgrade migrates data for subscriptions and favorites. These changes are not easily reverted should you choose to downgrade back to 2.5.</p>\n<p>For your convenience, I&#8217;ve clipped the portion from the full interview that includes our conversation about bbPress and BuddyPress that you can listen too below.</p>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-James-Jacoby-Gives-bbPress-2.6-Update.mp3\">https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-James-Jacoby-Gives-bbPress-2.6-Update.mp3</a>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 May 2017 20:19:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: New WordPress Plugin Blocks Spam User Registrations Using Stop Forum Spam Database\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-blocks-spam-user-registrations-using-stop-forum-spam-database\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3435:\"<p>When it comes to spam, comments are one of the first things that comes to mind.

Fiegel launched a new site over the weekend and despite not announcing it, it received a handful of spam registrations.</p>\n<p>After Googling the registrants&#8217; email addresses, he discovered a number of them were reported on Stop Forum Spam&#8217;s site. &#8220;I had never heard of Stop Forum Spam before, but it is basically an Akismet equivalent for forum sign up spam,&#8221; Fiegel said. &#8220;I noticed they had a dead link to a WordPress plugin. I looked up the <a href=\"http://stopforumspam.com/usage\">Stop Forum Spam API documentation</a> and built a basic one myself a couple of days ago. I submitted it to WordPress.org and it was approved within a day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When a user is blocked from registering, the following error is displayed: Cannot register. Please contact site administrator for assistance.</p>\n<p>Although users can check the<a href=\"http://stopforumspam.com/search\"> Stop Forum Spam database</a> to see if their email or IP address is blocked, the error message doesn&#8217;t inform them that Stop Forum Spam is what blocked their registration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted to keep the error message vague so users wouldn&#8217;t lash out at site administrators for accusing them of being &#8216;spammers&#8217; but clear enough that the site administrator would know it was a false positive when it was reported to them,&#8221; Fiegel said.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-signup-spam/\">plugin&#8217;s description</a>, Fiegel is clear about <a href=\"https://www.stopforumspam.com/privacy\">what data</a> is sent to the service. Each time a user attempts to register an account, an API call that contains the user&#8217;s email and IP address is sent to Stop Forum Spam and checked against its database. Although the plugin uses the service&#8217;s API, it does not require users to register for an API key. This allows the plugin to function upon activation without having to configure anything. Registrants that are incorrectly blocked as spammers can <a href=\"http://stopforumspam.com/removal\">submit a request</a> to have their IP or email address removed from the database.</p>\n<p>Fiegel has no plans to integrate support for other forms but is open to <a href=\"https://github.com/lelandf/stop-signup-spam\">pull requests</a> from those who would like to contribute integration support of their own. I did not test this plugin on an active site, but Fiegel says it has dramatically cut down on the number of spam registrations on his new site. If user spam registration is an issue you&#8217;re dealing with, consider giving <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-signup-spam/\">Stop Signup Spam</a> a try.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 May 2017 22:39:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"Matt: Everything is Hitched\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47310\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"https://ma.tt/2017/05/everything-is-hitched/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:184:\"<p><img /></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8212; John Muir</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 May 2017 18:29:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"BuddyPress: Largest Turkish Recipe Site Spiced Up with BuddyPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=265777\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/05/largest-turkish-recipe-site-spiced-up-with-buddypress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9626:\"<div><em>This a guest post by Mustafa Uysal (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/m_uysl\">m_uysl</a>).

It has more than 290,000 recipes that reach millions of users every single day. <a href=\"http://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/\">NefisYemekTarifleri</a> is a unique platform that uses WordPress and BuddyPress for all its applications &#8212; desktop, mobile web, Android, iOS, and AndroidTV.</p>\n<p><strong>Current status:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>290k+ recipes, <code>~500</code> new recipes from different authors per day</li>\n<li><code>~2.2M+</code> registered users with <code>~2.6M</code> xprofile_data, 24M+ usermeta</li>\n<li><code>~4M</code> native apps download, <code>~1M</code> active usage</li>\n<li><code>~100TB</code> CDN BW usage per month</li>\n<li>3M+ BuddyPress activities and <code>~4M+</code> notifications</li>\n<li>300k+ search requests per day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use <a href=\"https://uysalmustafa.com/2016/04/12/how-to-scale-10m-search-request-with-elasticpress/\">ElasticPress to handle 10M+ requests</a>. To scale this platform, we use various tools which we <a href=\"https://stackshare.io/nefisyemektarifleri-com/nefisyemektarifleri\">share at Stackshare</a>. We share some of our stats on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=nytstats&src=typd\">#nytstats</a>.</p>\n<h2>BuddyPress for a Growing User Base</h2>\n<p>NefisYemekTarifleri.com is turning 10 years old this August and has been using BuddyPress for the last 5 years. According to my boss, “BuddyPress has helped a lot to increase our user base.”</p>\n<p>Our platform is community-driven, i.e., all the recipes come from our users. The membership and number of recipes submitted have increased dramatically since we started using BuddyPress. The users feel more welcome because they have their &#8220;own space&#8221; where they can easily add their avatars, cover images, post their recipes, and share other social media links. BuddyPress has enabled users to engage more with other registered members as well as invite new users to the site. Our editorial team spends a majority of their time editing user recipe submissions.</p>\n<p>Currently, we are using all BuddyPress core components except Friends and Groups. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/r-a-y\">r-a-y</a>‘s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-followers/\">BuddyPress Followers</a> plugin is a great replacement to the built-in Friends component.</p>\n<h2>Customized BuddyPress Features</h2>\n<h3>Notifications</h3>\n<p>Our notification system is quite different from the standard BuddyPress notifications. It supports push and web push notifications and works async over the message queue.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-265786\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/nyt-notification-1024x512.jpg\" alt=\"Site notifications schema\" width=\"700\" height=\"350\" /></p>\n<p>There are a lot of activities which can trigger notifications. There were and are many instances when we send notifications to tens of thousands users every day. For example, when one author with thousands of &#8220;followers&#8221; publishes a new recipe, it took a long time to send a simple notification like, “Hi there! Jane Doe published a new recipe, take a look!” Consider when we have 10 authors with many followers publishing new recipes at the same time.</p>\n<p>In the early days, we created a custom `nyt_bp_add_notification` script which called BuddyPress’ own notification that added a function for bulk messaging. We found out that it was causing lags on our slave MySQL servers because the impact on the disk IO was dramatic. Our solution was a new custom script, `nyt_bp_add_bulk_notification`, which inserts data directly to database (as a bulk SQL query). By the way, we highly recommend Percona’s <a href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html\">PMM</a> for catching performance hogs.</p>\n<p>At the end of 2016, we migrated from parse.com to our <a href=\"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server\">self hosted parse</a> for push notifications. After which, we used <a href=\"https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push-php\">web-push-php</a> for the web push notifications.</p>\n<h3>Cover Image</h3>\n<p>We decided to replace the built-in cover image feature and create our own Facebook-inspired UI which was more user-friendly. The feedback has been quite positive from our members.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uysalmustafa.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/cover-image.gif\" width=\"981\" height=\"398\" alt=\"New cover image UI\" class=\"alignnone size-large\" /></p>\n<p>Features of our new cover image UI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user can directly upload a cover image by clicking on an icon on top of the cover image area.</li>\n<li>The full-size image is saved behind the scenes.</li>\n<li>Quick image resizing after the image upload has completed.</li>\n<li>A user can change image position via drag-drop.</li>\n<li>The full path and image coordinates are recorded as meta.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Messages</h3>\n<p>The Messaging component is active but not fully open for the end users. We will make this available for everyone when we&#8217;ve completed our mobile app integration. This is how we are setting this up for our site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All messages have to be between two people, we canceled group messaging.</li>\n<li>When someone you are not following sends a message, that message is marked as “pending”. You also &#8220;block&#8221; that person.</li>\n<li>Fluent messaging: all conversations between two people use the same thread.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Workarounds/Hacks/Yikes!</h2>\n<p><strong>Cache:</strong> We hated touching BuddyPress directly, but we had to hack core file to fix memory issues.  (We have submitted <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/7130/7130.diff\">a patch </a>that reduces memory usage for <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7130\">BP#7130</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Messaging, reimagined</strong>: We made some necessary changes a bit in a hacky way on the messaging component. Changing messaging behavior was not easy and there are some edge cases we have to monitor and address.</p>\n<p><strong>Limit notifications</strong>: Only allow 200 notifications per user, WordPress’ cron cleans up on a daily basis.</p>\n<p><strong>API Endpoints</strong>: We had to be careful on managing API endpoints, addressing the mobile apps a bit differently than web, especially when you do caching inside the device.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-running process</strong>: MQ workers are long-running PHP scripts and they caused memory problems on production after a while. We fixed this issue with <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/blob/157e65b112d90bcc15e532dc33f86592805cdb13/bin/wp-cli.php#L795\">stop_the_insanity</a>.</p>\n<h2>In the Works</h2>\n<p>Following are some of the features we have in queue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrading BuddyPress, of course</li>\n<li>Elasticsearch integration over ElasticPress. (We haven&#8217;t tried it yet but <a href=\"https://github.com/swissspidy\">Pascal</a> already wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/swissspidy/wptalents/blob/feature/buddypress-integration/classes/core/ElasticPress.php\">some code</a> we can start playing with.)</li>\n<li>User suggestion to follow a member.</li>\n<li>Activity improvements (currently, just acting like feed).</li>\n<li>PHP 7.1 upgrade with dockerizing all the things. (Still using different versions of PHP)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BuddyPress allows us to build one of the largest niche communities in the world. Fortunately for everyone, BuddyPress is being maintained by developers who are active contributors to WordPress core. Our thanks to all BuddyPress contributors, especially the BP core team.</p>\n<div><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-265793\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/05/m_uysl.jpeg\" alt=\"Mustafa Uysal\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /> <em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/m_uysl\">Mustafa Uysal</a> of <a href=\"http://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/\">NefisYemekTarifleri.com</a> also runs his own company, <a href=\"http://skop.com.tr/\">SKOP</a>.

Weglot will now detect a visitor&#8217;s language and automatically redirect to serve the translated page. Weglot users can also connect with <a href=\"https://www.textmaster.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Textmaster</a>&#8216;s marketplace to order professional translations through their accounts. The support burden has also increased from 10-20 emails per day to more than 80 per day, challenging the small team&#8217;s resources.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the past few months, we started to be overworked by the amount of support or the number of features we wanted to add to the product,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;We got a bit frustrated not to be able to improve the product as we wanted to through lack of time. So we understood that if we wanted to keep growing at a fast pace, we would need to scale up our two-person company and raising money was the perfect way to do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After making the connection with SIDE Capital at the end of 2016, Weglot decided to partner with them to fund the further expansion if its support team. The team is currently comprised of two founders, one lead developer, one head of support, and one support agent. Approximately 1,500 of Weglot&#8217;s 10,000 users are on an active paid plan, but the remaining 85% of free users make up a significant portion of the support load. Berda said they are investing their resources in support, which serves both free and paid users, in order to maintain the same quality.</p>\n<p>In tandem with improving the performance of the plugin and its support, Berda said the team is also developing other integrations to test Weglot&#8217;s service outside of the WordPress market.</p>\n<p>Weglot is growing rapidly in the North American market. Although the Asian market is not represented on the plugin&#8217;s user breakdown below, Berda said it has more than doubled in the past two months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have been seeing an accelerating growth in the Americas in the past 6 months,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;We went from 5% of our clients to 25% now. Asia is still small but has been quickly growing in the past two months from 3% to 8%.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/weglot-users-countries-breakdown.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>One year after officially launching Weglot, Berda and his team have found that WordPress is a ripe market for entrepreneurs who are ready to move quickly and provide a high level of customer service. His advice to newcomers?</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in the right place,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;WordPress is a huge market with real needs, and it is often overlooked by many entrepreneurs. There is an active and strong community with &#8216;caring&#8217; values.  So WordPress is definitely a great place to build a business.&#8221; He recommends keeping to a brisk timeline:</p>\n<p>&#8220;One month after you have the idea, you must have some people (1 to 10) testing a MVP,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;One more month later, you must have your first paying customer to validate the needs. Finally, never neglect customer support. Done carefully, customer supports transforms into customer acquisition.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 May 2017 20:13:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8 Release Targeted for June 8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69778\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-release-targeted-for-june-8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2349:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gutenberg-editor.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 kicked off in this week&#8217;s core developer meeting and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-8/\" target=\"_blank\">schedule</a> for the upcoming release is now published. Beta 1 is scheduled for May 12 and the official release is targeted for June 8. This will be the first major release in 2017 and is focused on laying the foundation for the new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg</a> editor. The schedule identifies the features that contributors are aiming to ship in 4.8:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TinyMCE inline element / link boundaries</li>\n<li>New media widgets</li>\n<li>WYSIWYG in text widget</li>\n<li>WordCamp / meetup dashboard upgrade to the “news” section</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several contributors expressed concern during the meeting about the compressed timeline, as both the beta and RC testing times have roughly half the time they have been given in the past. Also, the release&#8217;s close proximity to WordCamp Europe, which officially begins activities the following week, presented additional concerns about the added workload of a release within the May/June timeframe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think people are thinking of this as a normal release, a train leaving the station that a bunch of stuff (multisite! meta!) has to get on to make it in,&#8221; 4.8 release lead Matt Mullenweg said. &#8220;I agree that needs a much longer timeframe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What is really going on is that we have a few simple, already working as plugin enhancements that add a few files, and we want to get those in the hands of users sooner rather than later. We already update TinyMCE all the time. Potential breakage or compatibility should be limited to things that interact with the text widget or the news dashboard module.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After a brief discussion on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/04/dev-chat-summary-may-3rd-4-8-week-1/\" target=\"_blank\">dev meeting notes</a>, the proposed schedule was confirmed. The feature project merge deadline is coming up on May 10, followed by Beta 1 two days later. Any enhancements that are not ready to proceed on this timeline will be put on hold for a future release.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 May 2017 18:13:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: WPHugs: A Community Devoted to Educating, Discussing, and Raising Awareness of Mental Health\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69625\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/wphugs-a-community-devoted-to-educating-discussing-and-raising-awareness-of-mental-health\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3983:\"<p>In the past two years, there has been an increased effort in the WordPress community to raise awareness of mental health. <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/10/cory-miller-managing-your-iceberg/\">Cory Miller</a>, <a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/n53MNL3C\">Rich Robinkoff</a>, <a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/fBYZcOBz\">Michele Butcher</a>, and <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/talks/\">others</a> have presented on the subject at numerous WordCamps.</p>\n<p>A common theme that surrounds mental health is the fear of discussing it openly. <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/\">WPHugs.org</a>, a passion project by Leo Gopal, aims to provide a safe space for people to connect, educate, and raise awareness of mental health.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I suffered many times in my life so far with extreme depression,&#8221; Gopal said. &#8220;One of the most difficult parts of dealing with extreme depression is the feeling that you can&#8217;t tell anyone about it. This can include your boss or colleagues who you spend most of your time with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Until, at <a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/dhGqDhV5\">WordCamp Cape Town 2016</a>, I stood in front of a conference room full of people and &#8216;confessed&#8217; that I am afflicted with depression. After the talk, many people came to me and called me &#8216;brave&#8217; to be so open, and many opened up and thanked me for helping them realize that they too are not alone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After my recovery from attempted suicide, it was the friends I had made in the WordPress Community that gave me the most support. I reached my darkest point, and I got there feeling alone. WPHugs hopes to be a torch that allows others to never get to such a space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WPHugs has a <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation\">Slack group</a> that&#8217;s free to join that provides an opportunity for like-minded people to discuss topics in real-time. While the conversations in the Slack channel are not private, Gopal is hopeful that the community will be built around trust and honesty.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I suspect that there will be more direct messages than there will be channel messages, and that&#8217;s okay, the connections are being made, we are talking more,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>WPHugs is a not-for-profit passion project and although the site has <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/sponsorships/\">sponsorship opportunities</a> available, Gopal is looking for companies and people who can contribute time and resources.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If companies want to contribute licenses to their software to help expand, grow, reach more people, by all means it is completely welcome,&#8221; Gopal said. &#8220;Sponsor time or resources, whatever you can to make this project thrive and survive, because it&#8217;s important, it could save someone&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gopal admits he&#8217;s not an authority on how to maintain good mental health but plans to crowdsource tips, tricks, and host conversations to help others. Heavily inspired by <a href=\"http://heropress.com/\">HeroPress</a>, Gopal wants to publish weekly essays called Mental Health War Stories.</p>\n<p>The most important message WPHugs wants to get across is that people who are suffering from mental illnesses are not alone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about making us aware of ourselves, taking care of our own mental health and how important it is for those around us. It&#8217;s also about being more empathetic for those around us who suffer in their own way and know that someone cares,&#8221; Gopal said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I went through a struggle discovering my mental illness and learning about it, and I did it alone. I don&#8217;t want that journey for others to be as solitary. I am a hugger.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To share a mental health war story or to get involved with the project, you can get in touch with Gopal through the WPHugs <a href=\"https://wphugs.org/contact/\">contact form</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 May 2017 02:39:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: WordPress Security Issue in Password Reset Emails to Be Fixed in Future Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69665\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-security-issue-in-password-reset-emails-to-be-fixed-in-future-release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4135:\"<p>Security researcher Dawid Golunski of <a href=\"https://legalhackers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Legal Hackers</a> has published the details of an <a href=\"https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html\" target=\"_blank\">unauthorized password reset vulnerability</a> in WordPress core. Golunski demonstrated how, under certain circumstances, an attacker could intercept the password reset email and gain access to a user&#8217;s account.</p>\n<p>His proof of concept takes advantage of WordPress using the SERVER_NAME variable to get the hostname of the server in order to create a From/Return-Path header of the outgoing password reset email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Major web servers such as Apache by default set the SERVER_NAME variable using the hostname supplied by the client (within the HTTP_HOST header):</p>\n<p>https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#usecanonicalname</p>\n<p>Because SERVER_NAME can be modified, an attacker could set it to an arbitrary domain of his choice e.g:</p>\n<p>attackers-mxserver.com</p>\n<p>which would result in WordPress setting the $from_email to </p>\n<p>wordpress@attackers-mxserver.com</p>\n<p>and thus result in an outgoing email with From/Return-Path set to this malicious address.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The results of this particular attack would depend on the server environment, the specific configuration of the mail server, and in some cases would require interaction from the user in question. Golunski&#8217;s <a href=\"https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> has a more specific breakdown of the possible methods that could be employed.</p>\n<p>After reporting the issue to the WordPress security team in July 2016 and also via the HackerOne website, Golunski saw no progress on it and decided to release the vulnerability details to the public.</p>\n<p>Although there is no official patch yet, WordPress Security Czar Aaron Campbell said the issue is not quite as severe as it may seem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lower priority issue, but we are aware of it and it is in our queue to address,&#8221; Campbell said. He explained the unique set of conditions that would be required in order for this to be a serious vulnerability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In order for the issue to have a security impact, a server needs to allow a user-supplied header to overwrite <code>$_SERVER[\'SERVER_NAME\']</code>,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;We would consider that a poor server configuration (like leaving <code>display_errors</code> on on a production server), which is unfortunately outside our control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Campbell tested his personal Apache and nginx servers and none of them allowed for this. In addition to having a poorly configured server, Campbell said one of the following actions also needs to happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a user needs to reply to a password reset email</li>\n<li>an auto-reply needs to reply to the E-Mail and include the original</li>\n<li>an E-Mail server has to be compromised or overloaded and the message returned to sender with content intact</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;If your server is susceptible and you don&#8217;t have the ability to fix the actual server configuration, you still don&#8217;t have to make changes to WordPress files to mitigate the issue,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;A little PHP like this in a plugin will set the from E-Mail to a static E-Mail address of your choice:&#8221;</p>\n<p><code>add_filter( \'wp_mail_from\', function( $from_email ) { return \'wordpress@mysite.com\'; } );</code></p>\n<p>Campbell said any changes WordPress makes to core will likely be done via a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25239\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> that is currently tracking the issue from a non-security perspective. He said a fix is mostly likely not going to be coming in the next security release, but the team is actively working on it. If they find a good mitigation for the issue, Campbell said they will share it once they have worked through all the potential ramifications.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 May 2017 22:41:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: WordPress Community Team Considers New Retreat-Style WordCamp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=69642\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-considers-new-retreat-style-wordcamp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3741:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/journey.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/2DEL42UQ7M\">Jesse Bowser</a>\n<p>The WordPress Community Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/05/03/a-new-type-of-wordcamp/\" target=\"_blank\">debating the merits of a new type of WordCamp</a>, a hybrid event with the traditional WordCamp content in a retreat-style format. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mahype/\" target=\"_blank\">Sven Wagener</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Meetup-Koln/\" target=\"_blank\">Köln meetup group</a> in Germany, which has more than 700 members, have proposed a new style of camp that would potentially be called &#8220;WordCamp in the Green&#8221; or &#8220;WordCamp Retreat.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The event would be held outside of town at a venue where all attendees stay in the same hotel. In addition to the regular WordCamp sessions and Contributor Day, attendees have the opportunity to participate in local outdoor activities.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Community Team is open to considering different formats for WordCamps that serve a specific niche. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-for-publishers-to-be-held-in-denver-august-17-19\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp for Publishers</a>, the first WordCamp focused around a specific topic, is a recent example of this flexibility.</p>\n<p>The proposed format is very similar to the interest-based meetups that the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/community-translation-and-wapuu-how-japan-is-shaping-wordpress-history\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese WordPress community</a> has been doing for years. Members spend time together in activities unrelated to WordPress, as opposed to simply focusing on improving technical skills, and as a result they become more connected with their local community. For example, the <a href=\"http://2014onsen.wbsendai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Word温泉 (WordOnsen) meetup</a> includes members who enjoy hot springs. They gather in Fukushima where they stay at the same hotel, host WordPress sessions, and end with a party night. This format has successfully grown the Japanese meetup community to more than 50 local groups.</p>\n<p>The Köln meetup group&#8217;s proposal for a WordCamp doesn&#8217;t stray too far from the traditional WordCamp program, as the only differences seem to be a more rural setting where everyone stays at the same venue. A more radical change would be an event where WordPress community members meet simply for networking and connecting with no planned educational component. These types of niche unofficial WordCamps have been happening for years outside of the WordPress-sanctioned events.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Community Team is seeking feedback on the proposed &#8220;WordCamp Retreat,&#8221; as approval of the event would set a precedent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we introduce a new type of WordCamp event like this, we want it to be something that works in many communities, scales effectively for larger (or smaller) groups, and is able to be reproduced by any organizers who wish to do so,&#8221; Commnity Team member Hugh Lashbrooke said.</p>\n<p>The organizing team for the proposed WordCamp has already prepared a budget and is ready to move forward once given approval. Lashbrooke said the Community Team anticipates the new event types will have &#8220;a huge amount of interest from other communities around the world,&#8221; so they wanted to pitch it to the community for feedback.</p>\n<p>If you have strong opinions on the topic, you can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/05/03/a-new-type-of-wordcamp/\" target=\"_blank\">join the discussion on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 May 2017 02:05:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 271 – Recapping WordCamp Chicago 2017 With John James Jacoby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=69622&preview=true&preview_id=69622\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-271-recapping-wordcamp-chicago-2017-with-john-james-jacoby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2066:\"<p>In this episode, I&#8217;m joined by <a href=\"https://jjj.blog/\">John James Jacoby</a>.

We discussed what lessons he&#8217;s learned through open source software development that he&#8217;ll apply to his Trustee role.</p>\n<p>We talk about how important mental health is and near the end of the show, he provides status updates on the bbPress and BuddyPress projects.

One of the most useful ones for European websites is the new EU Cookie Law Banner widget. The WordPress plugin directory has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/eu+cookie+law/\" target=\"_blank\">dozens of plugins related to cookie consent</a>, but Jetpack users can now get this feature bundled with the popular plugin.</p>\n<p>The widget launches a notice at the bottom of the screen where users can click to accept cookies. The widget banner text, color scheme, policy URL, and button text can be customized, and administrators can hide the banner based on different user behaviors.</p>\n<p>The EU Cooke Law is an online privacy directive that was introduced in 2011 with the objective of allowing website visitors the right to refuse cookies that reduce their privacy. Sites that serve primarily EU audiences are required to comply. Companies in the U.S. and outside the EU with no legal EU presence are not likely to have any consequences for not complying, as the law is difficult to enforce outside the EU.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/internet-defense-league-red-cat.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Jetpack 4.9 also adds a new Flickr widget and one for the <a href=\"https://www.internetdefenseleague.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Defense League</a>, an organization dedicated to defending internet freedom.

That’s how we grew our company from 25 employees and $4 million a year in revenue to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million.\r\n\r\nIt all started back in 1976 when Mike Condon and James Johnson transformed Kulchin and Associates, Inc — a small shoring and foundation company responsible for completing the first soil nailing project in the Western Hemisphere — into Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates. Mike, with his background in cost-effective, quality construction at Peter Kiewit and Sons, joined Kulchin as General Manager and Vice President in search of new challenges in 1985. He eventually acquired control of the company, and, with James Johnson as his business partner, Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates was born.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\nWith a culture marked by the vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies, CJA quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.

Honesty. Integrity.\r\n\r\nOver the last three decades we have grown from a small shoring and foundation company to the leader in geotechnical construction on the West Coast. What sets CJA apart is our willingness and ability to provide an innovative and cost effective complete package from design to piling or drilled shafts to shoring. CJA is constantly seeking out and implementing new or improved methods to save your project time and cost.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\nCondon-Johnson &amp; Associates provides you with a dependable geotechnical contractor to overcome even the most challenging tasks and terrains.

Mike Condon and James Johnson transformed that small company into Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates (CJA) a leader in geotechnical construction on the West Coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1980Γò¼├┤Γö£├ºΓö£├╗s at Peter Kiewit and Sons, Mike Condon had built a 13-year career on cost-effective, quality construction. In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\nWith demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.\r\n\r\nSadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on. His commitment to treating people with fairness, honesty, simplicity, and integrity is carried forward by the company that bears his name.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"bg-image\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"vision-and-values\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<h2>VISION AND VALUES</h2>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row text\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\nOur experience in geotechnical design and construction spans more than three decades.

In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson & Associates.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                        <p>With demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.</p>\r\n                        <p>Sadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on.

Mike Condon and James Johnson transformed that small company into Condon-Johnson & Associates (CJA) a leader in geotechnical construction on the West Coast of the United States.</p>\r\n                        <p>By the early 1980╬ô├ç├ûs at Peter Kiewit and Sons, Mike Condon had built a 13-year career on cost-effective, quality construction. In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson & Associates.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n                        <p>With demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.</p>\r\n                        <p>Sadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on.

Drilled shafts, also known as drilled piers, Cast-in-Drilled-Hole Piles (CIDH piles) or Cast-in-Situ piles are used to transfer structural loads and moments through the relatively weak upper strata of many sites to deeper, stronger soils which have sufficient capacity for the anticipated loading</p>\r\n                                <p class=\"text\">Drilled shafts are deep, cylindrical, cast-in-place concrete foundations reinforced using full-length rebar cages and formed by a drilled borehole excavation. They can range in diameter from 18-inches to greater than 20-feet and reach depths over 250 feet. They are often used as a structural support where seismic  loadings create large moment requirements with  ultimately govern the bridge foundation design. Drilled shafts have additional foundation uses including, building support, cantilevered signs, communication towers, and landslide retention...</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-6 text-center\">\r\n                                <img src=\"/wp-content/themes/condon-johnson/images/services-lines.png\" alt=\"services\" class =\"hidden-lg hidden-md hidden-sm\"/>\r\n                                <div class=\"image-wrapper hidden-xs\">\r\n                                    <div class=\"image image-color\">\r\n                                        <img src=\"/wp-content/themes/condon-johnson/images/services-color.png\" alt=\"services\"/>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div class=\"image image-lines\">\r\n                                        <img src=\"/wp-content/themes/condon-johnson/images/services-lines.png\" alt=\"services\"/>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class =\"presentation presentation-3\">\r\n                    <div class=\"container\">\r\n                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                            <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-6\">\r\n                                <div class=\"title\">AUGER CAST PILES</div>\r\n                                <p class=\"text\">Auger Cast piles or Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles are created by rotating a continuous flight auger into the ground to a specified depth and then slowly withdrawing the auger while pumping cementitious grout under pressure to create the pile as the auger is retracted.

1976 a small shoring and foundation company, Kulchin and Associates, Inc., utilizing the newest technologies, completed the first soil nailing project in the Western Hemisphere. Mike Condon and James Johnson transformed that small company into Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates (CJA) a leader in geotechnical construction on the West Coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1980╬ô├ç├ûs at Peter Kiewit and Sons, Mike Condon had built a 13-year career on cost-effective, quality construction. In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\nWith demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.\r\n\r\nSadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on. His commitment to treating people with fairness, honesty, simplicity, and integrity is carried forward by the company that bears his name.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"bg-image\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"vision-and-values\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<h2>VISION AND VALUES</h2>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row text\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\nOur experience in geotechnical design and construction spans more than three decades.

Mike Condon and James Johnson transformed that small company into Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates (CJA) a leader in geotechnical construction on the West Coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1980╬ô├ç├ûs at Peter Kiewit and Sons, Mike Condon had built a 13-year career on cost-effective, quality construction. In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\nWith demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.\r\n\r\nSadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on. His commitment to treating people with fairness, honesty, simplicity, and integrity is carried forward by the company that bears his name.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"bg-image\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"vision-and-values\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<h2>VISION AND VALUES</h2>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row text\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\nOur experience in geotechnical design and construction spans more than three decades.

Mike Condon and James Johnson transformed that small company into Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates (CJA) a leader in geotechnical construction on the West Coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1980╬ô├ç├ûs at Peter Kiewit and Sons, Mike Condon had built a 13-year career on cost-effective, quality construction. In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\nWith demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.\r\n\r\nSadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on. His commitment to treating people with fairness, honesty, simplicity, and integrity is carried forward by the company that bears his name.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"bg-image\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"vision-and-values\">\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<div class=\"text-center\">\r\n<h2>VISION AND VALUES</h2>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"row text\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n\r\nOur experience in geotechnical design and construction spans more than three decades.

Tiedowns are typically used to resist hydrostatic uplift forces on underwater slabs and static or seismic overturning moment uplift forces in retaining walls or shear walls. Tiedown design should consider both individual anchor capacity and overall stability of the ground mass the tiedown is anchored to. Tiedown load is carried in steel reinforcement and transferred by friction into surrounding ground.\r\n                          </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"title\">Micropiles</div>\r\n\r\n                          <p class=\"text\">\r\n  Micropiles are 12-inch or less in diameter and constructed using high-strength steel casing and/or threaded bar. Micropiles are designed to carry compressive or tensile loads and can exceed depths of 200 feet with loads over 200 tons. The micropile casing typically ranges in diameter of 5 to 12 inches and is made of high-strength N-80 steel. The casing extends to the top of the bond zone or it can be plunged several feet into the bond zone to provide a stiff cross section and limit elastic deformation of the pile under load.\r\n                          </p>\r\n                          <p class=\"text\">\r\n  Condon-Johnson & Associates (CJA) uses the latest technology and equipment for limited access micropile installation for virtually any location and every ground condition with minimal vibration and disturbance. Generally, micropiles are used when there is a relatively high tensile load requirement since grouting techniques allow much higher bond stress than conventional drilled or driven piles, excessive variation in the depth to soil or rock targeted for bond zone, and/or limited headroom. Our micropile drill rigs allow for installation in areas with low headroom and restricted access with minimal disturbance to normal facility operations. Micropiles are often additionally used to underpin existing buildings or to increase the bearing capacity for building upgrades or seismic retrofit.\r\n                          </p>\r\n                          <p class=\"text\">\r\n  CJA offers design/build services for micropile installation and works closely with engineers, contractors, and owners to ensure a pile cross section that meets the performance requirements of the structural engineer and an installation method that achieves the necessary capacity while minimizing the disturbance to building occupants and existing foundations.\r\nMicropiles can be used to offer a cost effective way to provide tensile capacity to seismic upgrades, tensile and compression capacity to increase load carrying ability of new and existing footings, tensile and compression capacity to limited access work areas, and underpinning solutions for your earth retention challenges. For more information on the cost saving benefits, design build options, and CJA’s expertise on micropiles, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n                          </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"title\">Drilled Shafts</div>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nCondon-Johnson & Associates (CJA) is proud of a long and successful record of installing drilled shafts of all sizes and depths. Drilled shafts, also known as drilled piers, Cast-in-Drilled-Hole Piles (CIDH piles), or Cast-in-Situ piles, are used to transfer structural loads and moments through the relatively weak upper strata of many sites to deeper, stronger soils which have sufficient capacity for the anticipated loading.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nDrilled shafts are deep, cylindrical, cast-in-place concrete foundations reinforced using full-length rebar cages and formed by a drilled borehole excavation. They can range in diameter from 18-inches to greater than 20-feet and reach depths over 250 feet. They are often used as a structural support where seismic loadings create large moment requirements which ultimately govern the bridge foundation design. Drilled shafts have additional foundation uses including building support, cantilevered signs, communication towers, and landslide retention.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nConstruction methods depend on the geology of the site and on-site access. CJA is competent with dry, wet (slurry), and oscillated/rotated cased drilling methods. Dry drilling methods are used in non-caving, cohesive soils, which are generally located above the local ground water table. An auger is advanced (it must be removed periodically to remove the borehole soils) until bottom of pile elevation is reached. A cleanout bucket is then used to ensure the bottom of the hole is free of debris.\r\nWet or slurry drilling methods are used where caving of the drilled borehole is probable, typically when the local ground water table is located within the length of the shaft. By maintaining the slurry or water above the ground water table while drilling, a positive pressure will be exerted on the sides of the shaft to prevent the inward flow of water and the likelihood of caving is reduced. There are three different classifications of drilling fluid: freshwater, mineral, or polymer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nCasing construction methods are applicable where wet or slurry drilling methods are used. The cased method uses a temporary steel casing that is installed in the excavation to provide the lateral support necessary for maintaining the integrity of the hole. CJA uses the latest European and North American innovations for installation of the casing using an oscillator or rotator to minimize vibrations while advancing casing from 3-ft to 10-ft in diameter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nOur drilled shafts are regularly tested using state-of-the art non-destructive testing techniques and receive approval ratings high above industry standards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for drilled shafts, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"title\">Displacement Piles</div>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nAuger Displacement piles are similar to Auger-Cast Piles but instead of a continuous auger flight, the specialized screw shaped auger displaces the soils laterally toward the bore hole walls to increase the density of the surrounding soils and increase the capacity of the resulting pile. An added benefit of the displacement pile is that there are essentially no drill spoils generated by the installation process of a displacement pile. Aside from reducing the cost of spoils handling, the lack of spoils is even more significant for projects with contaminated soils. Displacement piles offer a cost saving approach and reduce the hazards of handling contaminated soils.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nAs the specialized auger drills, the soil is laterally displaced until tip of pile elevation is reached. High slump sand mix grout/concrete is then pumped out through the hollow stem auger as the tool is withdrawn from the bottom of the drill hole. After grouting of the pile is complete, a reinforcement cage is installed. The inherent soil improvement process of displacement pile installation results in greater lateral capacities compared to conventional in-situ piles. Displacement piles also offer a low-noise, vibration free installation process. A huge advantage of this is where deep foundation support is needed in sensitive areas where noise and vibrations are not allowed. Vibration or pile driving in areas of sensitive soils can cause settlement which can lead to project delays or claims.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nFor more information on the cost saving, design/build options, and environmental benefits that CJA’s expertise on displacement piles can offer your project, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"title\">Barettes</div>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nBarettes are rectangular load bearing piles that are constructed under slurry. They are often used in conjunction with diaphragm wall construction due to the equipment/methodology being common between both techniques. Barettes are typically constructed in areas with dense/historic infrastructure where a rigid shoring system is required, noise and vibration are required to be limited, and dewatering is not considered practical to allow convention earth retention systems or where a top down construction technique is preferred.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nBarettes have a greater resistance to horizontal stress and bending movements than circular piles of the same section and due to their larger perimeter they have an increased lateral friction compared to a circular pile of the same section. Due to their mammoth size, barettes can lend themselves to top down or conventional basement construction methods on high rise buildings with deep basement excavations. Barettes can be constructed singular or jointed together for larger sizes. Excavation of the barette can extend into rock for higher loadings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for barettes, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"title\">Auger Cast Piles</div>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nAuger Cast piles, or Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles, are created by rotating a continuous flight auger into the ground to a specified depth and then slowly withdrawing the auger while pumping cementitious grout under pressure to create the pile as the auger is retracted. As the auger is retracted, the spoils on the auger are continuously removed by a small excavator or loader. Once the pile has been grouted and auger completely removed from the pile, reinforcing cages may then be set into the previously placed concrete.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nThe quality of the auger cast pile is largely dependent on the skill and experience of the contractor performing the work. Condon-Johnson & Associates is continuously selected for auger cast pile installation due to our vast experience and positive reviews from designers, contractors, and owners after the project is completed.\r\nFor more information on the cost saving benefits, design/build options, and CJA’s expertise on auger cast piles, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

Micropiles are designed to carry compressive or tensile loads and can exceed depths of 200 feet with loads over 200 tons. The micropile casing typically ranges in diameter of 5 to 12 inches and is made of high-strength N-80 steel. The casing extends to the top of the bond zone or it can be plunged several feet into the bond zone to provide a stiff cross section and limit elastic deformation of the pile under load.\n                          </p>\n                          <p class=\"text\">\n  Condon-Johnson & Associates (CJA) uses the latest technology and equipment for limited access micropile installation for virtually any location and every ground condition with minimal vibration and disturbance. Generally, micropiles are used when there is a relatively high tensile load requirement since grouting techniques allow much higher bond stress than conventional drilled or driven piles, excessive variation in the depth to soil or rock targeted for bond zone, and/or limited headroom. Our micropile drill rigs allow for installation in areas with low headroom and restricted access with minimal disturbance to normal facility operations. Micropiles are often additionally used to underpin existing buildings or to increase the bearing capacity for building upgrades or seismic retrofit.\n                          </p>\n                          <p class=\"text\">\n  CJA offers design/build services for micropile installation and works closely with engineers, contractors, and owners to ensure a pile cross section that meets the performance requirements of the structural engineer and an installation method that achieves the necessary capacity while minimizing the disturbance to building occupants and existing foundations.\nMicropiles can be used to offer a cost effective way to provide tensile capacity to seismic upgrades, tensile and compression capacity to increase load carrying ability of new and existing footings, tensile and compression capacity to limited access work areas, and underpinning solutions for your earth retention challenges. For more information on the cost saving benefits, design build options, and CJA’s expertise on micropiles, please contact our nearest office location.\n                          </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"title\">Drilled Shafts</div>\n<p class=\"text\">\nCondon-Johnson & Associates (CJA) is proud of a long and successful record of installing drilled shafts of all sizes and depths. Drilled shafts, also known as drilled piers, Cast-in-Drilled-Hole Piles (CIDH piles), or Cast-in-Situ piles, are used to transfer structural loads and moments through the relatively weak upper strata of many sites to deeper, stronger soils which have sufficient capacity for the anticipated loading.\n</p>\n<p class=\"text\">\nDrilled shafts are deep, cylindrical, cast-in-place concrete foundations reinforced using full-length rebar cages and formed by a drilled borehole excavation. They can range in diameter from 18-inches to greater than 20-feet and reach depths over 250 feet. They are often used as a structural support where seismic loadings create large moment requirements which ultimately govern the bridge foundation design. Drilled shafts have additional foundation uses including building support, cantilevered signs, communication towers, and landslide retention.\n</p>\n<p class=\"text\">\nConstruction methods depend on the geology of the site and on-site access. CJA is competent with dry, wet (slurry), and oscillated/rotated cased drilling methods. Dry drilling methods are used in non-caving, cohesive soils, which are generally located above the local ground water table. An auger is advanced (it must be removed periodically to remove the borehole soils) until bottom of pile elevation is reached. A cleanout bucket is then used to ensure the bottom of the hole is free of debris.\nWet or slurry drilling methods are used where caving of the drilled borehole is probable, typically when the local ground water table is located within the length of the shaft. By maintaining the slurry or water above the ground water table while drilling, a positive pressure will be exerted on the sides of the shaft to prevent the inward flow of water and the likelihood of caving is reduced. There are three different classifications of drilling fluid: freshwater, mineral, or polymer.\n</p>\n<p class=\"text\">\n\n</p>\n<p class=\"text\">\n\n</p>\n<p class=\"text\">\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"title\">Drilled Shafts</div>\n<p class=\"text\">\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-center\">\n\n                        <div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n                            <div class=\"image image-color hidden-sm hidden-xs\"></div>\n                            <div class=\"image image-lines\"></div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n\n\n','Deep Foundation','','inherit','closed','closed','','140-autosave-v1','','','2017-02-10 17:23:03','2017-02-10 17:23:03','',140,'http://cj/2017/02/10/140-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(147,1,'2017-02-10 17:06:04','2017-02-10 17:06:04','<div class =\"presentation presentation-1\">\r\n            <div class=\"container\">\r\n                <div class=\"row\">\r\n                    <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12\">\r\n                        <div class=\"title\">Deep Foundation</div>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nTiedown refers to a vertical or downward inclined drilled and grouted ground anchors subjected to uplift forces.

Drilled shafts, also known as drilled piers, Cast-in-Drilled-Hole Piles (CIDH piles), or Cast-in-Situ piles, are used to transfer structural loads and moments through the relatively weak upper strata of many sites to deeper, stronger soils which have sufficient capacity for the anticipated loading.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nDrilled shafts are deep, cylindrical, cast-in-place concrete foundations reinforced using full-length rebar cages and formed by a drilled borehole excavation. They can range in diameter from 18-inches to greater than 20-feet and reach depths over 250 feet. They are often used as a structural support where seismic loadings create large moment requirements which ultimately govern the bridge foundation design.

An added benefit of the displacement pile is that there are essentially no drill spoils generated by the installation process of a displacement pile. Aside from reducing the cost of spoils handling, the lack of spoils is even more significant for projects with contaminated soils. Displacement piles offer a cost saving approach and reduce the hazards of handling contaminated soils.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nAs the specialized auger drills, the soil is laterally displaced until tip of pile elevation is reached. High slump sand mix grout/concrete is then pumped out through the hollow stem auger as the tool is withdrawn from the bottom of the drill hole. After grouting of the pile is complete, a reinforcement cage is installed. The inherent soil improvement process of displacement pile installation results in greater lateral capacities compared to conventional in-situ piles. Displacement piles also offer a low-noise, vibration free installation process. A huge advantage of this is where deep foundation support is needed in sensitive areas where noise and vibrations are not allowed. Vibration or pile driving in areas of sensitive soils can cause settlement which can lead to project delays or claims.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nFor more information on the cost saving, design/build options, and environmental benefits that CJA’s expertise on displacement piles can offer your project, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"title\">Barettes</div>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nBarettes are rectangular load bearing piles that are constructed under slurry. They are often used in conjunction with diaphragm wall construction due to the equipment/methodology being common between both techniques. Barettes are typically constructed in areas with dense/historic infrastructure where a rigid shoring system is required, noise and vibration are required to be limited, and dewatering is not considered practical to allow convention earth retention systems or where a top down construction technique is preferred.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nBarettes have a greater resistance to horizontal stress and bending movements than circular piles of the same section and due to their larger perimeter they have an increased lateral friction compared to a circular pile of the same section. Due to their mammoth size, barettes can lend themselves to top down or conventional basement construction methods on high rise buildings with deep basement excavations. Barettes can be constructed singular or jointed together for larger sizes. Excavation of the barette can extend into rock for higher loadings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for barettes, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"title\">Auger Cast Piles</div>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nAuger Cast piles, or Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles, are created by rotating a continuous flight auger into the ground to a specified depth and then slowly withdrawing the auger while pumping cementitious grout under pressure to create the pile as the auger is retracted. As the auger is retracted, the spoils on the auger are continuously removed by a small excavator or loader. Once the pile has been grouted and auger completely removed from the pile, reinforcing cages may then be set into the previously placed concrete.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"text\">\r\nThe quality of the auger cast pile is largely dependent on the skill and experience of the contractor performing the work.

Next, the soil nail holes are drilled at a slight inclination and the threaded steel soil nail bar is inserted and grouted in a 4 to 6 inch diameter hole to insure that the soil acts as a coherent soil mass. This is designed to act as a gravity block to resist bearing capacity failure, sliding, and global rotation.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nThen, vertical water drainage strips are placed on the excavated soil face to ensure drainage and prevent build-up of hydrostatic pressures on the wall. Metal reinforcing is then installed and shotcrete is applied to the exposed soil face. Excavation then resumes for the next lift. A rod-finish is applied to the shotcrete for temporary walls. Permanent shotcrete walls often have a second layer of shotcrete applied that is typically sculpted and colored to replicate local rock formations.\r\nSoil nail walls can offer a reduced construction time and cost savings compared to other shoring systems.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.  Condon-Johnson owns and operates ABI mobilram equipment, which was designed specifically for the installation of sheet piling. The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques.

Next, the soil nail holes are drilled at a slight inclination and the threaded steel soil nail bar is inserted and grouted in a 4 to 6 inch diameter hole to insure that the soil acts as a coherent soil mass. This is designed to act as a gravity block to resist bearing capacity failure, sliding, and global rotation.\n                        </p>\n                        <p class=\"text\">\nThen, vertical water drainage strips are placed on the excavated soil face to ensure drainage and prevent build-up of hydrostatic pressures on the wall. Metal reinforcing is then installed and shotcrete is applied to the exposed soil face. Excavation then resumes for the next lift. A rod-finish is applied to the shotcrete for temporary walls. Permanent shotcrete walls often have a second layer of shotcrete applied that is typically sculpted and colored to replicate local rock formations.\nSoil nail walls can offer a reduced construction time and cost savings compared to other shoring systems.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\n\n                        </p>\n                        <p class=\"text\">\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.  Condon-Johnson owns and operates ABI mobilram equipment, which was designed specifically for the installation of sheet piling. The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\n                        </p>\n                        <p class=\"text\">\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\n                        </p>\n                        <p class=\"text\">\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques. This can be seen on many of the different types of projects Condon-Johnson has completed including piling projects (sheet piling, soldier piling, and auger cast piling) and ground improvement projects (vibro-densification and soil mixing). In using the right tools for the job, Condon-Johnson has become an industry leader in the construction of specialty foundations.\n                        </p>\n                        <p class=\"text\">\nFor more information on the cost saving benefits and CJA’s expertise on sheet piling, please contact our nearest office location.\n\n                        </p>\n\n\n\n                        <div class=\"title\">Shear Pins</div>\n                        <p class=\"text\">\nShear Pin refers to steel beam or steel bar reinforced drilled shafts to reinforce slopes.

Usually the piles are installed in an alternative fashion along the line of the wall leaving a clear space of a little under the diameter of the required intermediate piles. The intermediate piles are then installed after their adjacent piles have had some time to set-up. Condon-Johnson & Associates is experienced in building hard/soft, hard/firm, and hard/hard secant pile walls over 150 feet deep.\n\n                        </p>\n                        <p class=\"text\">\nIn a tangent pile wall, there is no overlap as the piles are constructed flush to each other. Both types of piles are reinforced with either steel rebar or with steel beams. Where the bottom of the excavation is below the ground water table and water permeability is a requirement, secant walls systems can be combined with jet grouting at the base of the excavation “bottom plug” so that the excavation remains watertight.\n                        </p>\n                        <p class=\"text\">\nSecant pile walls offer an increased stiffness compared to sheet pile walls, decreased noise during installation, and are installed with minimized vibrations using an oscillator for sensitive areas where settlement and/or noise is an issue.

Soldier pile walls can be permanent or temporary in nature and are commonly used to support open excavations next to adjacent roads, utilities, and structures, and to provide permanent support for new highway cuts or existing land slide conditions.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nSoldier pile walls consist of wide flange steel piles that are driven or drilled into the ground 6 to 8 feet apart along the wall alignment before excavation begins. As the excavation progresses, horizontal timber lagging is installed between the piles in 5 foot “lifts” to resist the load of the retained soil and transfer the load to the piles. Depending on the depth of the excavation and the sensitivity of surrounding structures and utilities to movement, Post-tensioned anchors and/or internal bracing can then be installed at intervals to provide lateral support to the solider beams. The lagging “lift” and excavation cycle continues until the bottom of excavation depth is reached.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nSoldier pile walls can be either temporary or permanent.

Soil nailing can be used for both temporary and permanent earth retention applications, and permanent slope stabilization.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nSoil nailing is an earth retention technique using grouted tension-resisting steel bars (soil nails) and shotcrete facing to stabilize a section of ground as excavation proceeds from the top down.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nThe first step of construction is the excavation of the “lift” from the top down to a predetermined height which is typically 4 to 6 feet below existing grade. Next, the soil nail holes are drilled at a slight inclination and the threaded steel soil nail bar is inserted and grouted in a 4 to 6 inch diameter hole to insure that the soil acts as a coherent soil mass. This is designed to act as a gravity block to resist bearing capacity failure, sliding, and global rotation.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nThen, vertical water drainage strips are placed on the excavated soil face to ensure drainage and prevent build-up of hydrostatic pressures on the wall. Metal reinforcing is then installed and shotcrete is applied to the exposed soil face. Excavation then resumes for the next lift. A rod-finish is applied to the shotcrete for temporary walls. Permanent shotcrete walls often have a second layer of shotcrete applied that is typically sculpted and colored to replicate local rock formations.\r\nSoil nail walls can offer a reduced construction time and cost savings compared to other shoring systems.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.  Condon-Johnson owns and operates ABI mobilram equipment, which was designed specifically for the installation of sheet piling. The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques.

In using the right tools for the job, Condon-Johnson has become an industry leader in the construction of specialty foundations.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nFor more information on the cost saving benefits and CJA’s expertise on sheet piling, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"title\">Shear Pins</div>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nShear Pin refers to steel beam or steel bar reinforced drilled shafts to reinforce slopes.

Usually the piles are installed in an alternative fashion along the line of the wall leaving a clear space of a little under the diameter of the required intermediate piles. The intermediate piles are then installed after their adjacent piles have had some time to set-up. Condon-Johnson & Associates is experienced in building hard/soft, hard/firm, and hard/hard secant pile walls over 150 feet deep.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nIn a tangent pile wall, there is no overlap as the piles are constructed flush to each other.

Stone columns are used to increase the bearing capacity and mitigate liquefaction of cohesive soils and densify granular soils underneath the future foundation of a structure and/or embankments. They also reduce total and differential settlement of the structure.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nCJA utilizes two methods to install stone columns — wet top feed and dry bottom feed. In the bottom feed system, the vibroprobe is inserted into the ground to the target depth using compressed air or water jetting, and the weight of the probe. Aggregate is then tremied through a steel pipe to the bottom of the probe where the aggregate is then compacted by raising and lowering the probe repeatedly through the placed aggregate to increase the diameter of the column and densify the surrounding soils.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise, design/build options, and services for stone columns, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"title\">\r\n                          Soil Mixing\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nSoil Mixing is the process of constructing in-situ soil-cement columns. Cementitious grout is injected into the soils as a drill rig advances drill steel with a radial mixing paddle (single axis), radial mixing paddles (multi-axis), and/or rotating drums with blades (Cutter Soil Mixing) located near the bottom of the drill string, to plan depth. The radial mixing paddle(s) mechanically cuts and blends the soil with the injected grout. This process creates in-situ soil-cement individual columns, rows of overlapping columns, or 100% mass stabilization.\r\nSingle Axis Soil Mixing\r\n                        </p>\r\n                       \r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"title\">\r\n                           Permeation/Dam Grouting\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nCondon-Johnson & Associates (CJA) is a recognized leader in the ground improvement industry and has a track record of successful projects in which cost-effective ground improvement techniques have been used, including permeation/dam grouting.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nPermeation/dam grouting — also known as slurry grouting or high mobility grouting — is the injection of specially designed cement-based mixes into the pore spaces of granular soils or into the voids, open joints, or shear zones in rock. In turn, the native soil or rock formation’s strength is increased and permeability is decreased. CJA offers cement grouting technologies that are cost-effective as well as permanent solutions to reduce water flow through rock formations beneath dams, underpin foundations, and/or provide excavation support. In rock foundation,  a small diameter hole is drilled to intercept the voids, fissures, or cracks and grout is pumped under pressure into the void spaces or cracks to improve their stability or reduce permeability. In soils, a small diameter hole is drilled and a sleeve port packer pipe is grouted in place to isolate the various treatment depths within the hole and to prevent grout communication with the ground surface.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nCJA has developed its own computer-monitored grouting software to allow real-time monitoring of all grouting parameters during the project.

The grout is typically injected up stage as the injection pipe is extracted in 2-ft to 3-ft stages to to create a column of overlapping grout bulbs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nGrout is usually injected until a predetermined volume is injected or a pressure at a given injection rate is reached. Granular soils are densified as the grout bulb at the end of the injection pipe forces water and/or air out of the voids and the soils density, friction angle, and stiffness increase.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text\">\r\nCompaction grouting is used to increase bearing capacity, decrease settlement and liquefaction potential, treat existing sinkholes, or reduce the sinkhole potential in areas of karst ground conditions.\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise, design/build options, and services for compaction grouting, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-center\">\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\"image-wrapper\">\r\n                            <div class=\"image image-color hidden-sm hidden-xs\"></div>\r\n                            <div class=\"image image-lines\"></div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>','Ground Improvement','','inherit','closed','closed','','173-revision-v1','','','2017-02-13 08:26:03','2017-02-13 08:26:03','',173,'http://cj/2017/02/13/173-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0);
