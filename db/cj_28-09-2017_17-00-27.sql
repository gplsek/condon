Mike Condon and James Johnson transformed that small company into Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates (CJA) a leader in geotechnical construction on the West Coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1980Γò¼├┤Γö£├ºΓö£├╗s at Peter Kiewit and Sons, Mike Condon had built a 13-year career on cost-effective, quality construction. In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-6">\r\n\r\nWith demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.\r\n\r\nSadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on.

Mike Condon and James Johnson transformed that small company into Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates (CJA) a leader in geotechnical construction on the West Coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1980Γò¼├┤Γö£├ºΓö£├╗s at Peter Kiewit and Sons, Mike Condon had built a 13-year career on cost-effective, quality construction. In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-6">\r\n\r\nWith demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.\r\n\r\nSadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on. His commitment to treating people with fairness, honesty, simplicity, and integrity is carried forward by the company that bears his name.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="bg-image"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="vision-and-values">\r\n<div class="container">\r\n<div class="text-center">\r\n<h2>VISION AND VALUES</h2>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="row text">\r\n<div class="col-md-6">\r\n\r\nOur experience in geotechnical design and construction spans more than three decades.

In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-6">\r\n\r\nWith demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.\r\n\r\nSadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on.

Mike Condon and James Johnson transformed that small company into Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates (CJA) a leader in geotechnical construction on the West Coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1980╬ô├ç├ûs at Peter Kiewit and Sons, Mike Condon had built a 13-year career on cost-effective, quality construction. In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-6">\r\n\r\nWith demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.\r\n\r\nSadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on. His commitment to treating people with fairness, honesty, simplicity, and integrity is carried forward by the company that bears his name.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="bg-image"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="vision-and-values">\r\n<div class="container">\r\n<div class="text-center">\r\n<h2>VISION AND VALUES</h2>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="row text">\r\n<div class="col-md-6">\r\n\r\nOur experience in geotechnical design and construction spans more than three decades.

In 1985, in search of new challenges Mike joined Kulchin and Associates, Inc., as General Manager and Vice President. In his new position, he instituted a culture of vigorous pursuit and development of innovative engineering technologies. In the following years Mike acquired control of the company, and with James Johnson as his business partner, changed its name to Condon-Johnson &amp; Associates.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="col-md-6">\r\n\r\nWith demonstrated proficiency in the full range of specialty foundation services and ground improvement methods, Mike and James grew the company from 25 employees and revenues of $4 million per year to 300 employees and annual revenues of $85 million. Mike capitalized on the expanding expertise and innovations to create a company that quickly became a leader in the field of heavy civil geotechnical construction and engineering.\r\n\r\nSadly, we lost Mike in 2002 to an untimely death, but his legacy lives on.

Tiedowns are typically used to resist hydrostatic uplift forces on underwater slabs and static or seismic overturning moment uplift forces in retaining walls or shear walls. Tiedown design should consider both individual anchor capacity and overall stability of the ground mass the tiedown is anchored to. Tiedown load is carried in steel reinforcement and transferred by friction into surrounding ground.\r\n                          </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="title">Micropiles</div>\r\n\r\n                          <p class="text">\r\n  Micropiles are 12-inch or less in diameter and constructed using high-strength steel casing and/or threaded bar. Micropiles are designed to carry compressive or tensile loads and can exceed depths of 200 feet with loads over 200 tons. The micropile casing typically ranges in diameter of 5 to 12 inches and is made of high-strength N-80 steel. The casing extends to the top of the bond zone or it can be plunged several feet into the bond zone to provide a stiff cross section and limit elastic deformation of the pile under load.\r\n                          </p>\r\n                          <p class="text">\r\n  Condon-Johnson & Associates (CJA) uses the latest technology and equipment for limited access micropile installation for virtually any location and every ground condition with minimal vibration and disturbance. Generally, micropiles are used when there is a relatively high tensile load requirement since grouting techniques allow much higher bond stress than conventional drilled or driven piles, excessive variation in the depth to soil or rock targeted for bond zone, and/or limited headroom. Our micropile drill rigs allow for installation in areas with low headroom and restricted access with minimal disturbance to normal facility operations. Micropiles are often additionally used to underpin existing buildings or to increase the bearing capacity for building upgrades or seismic retrofit.\r\n                          </p>\r\n<a name="drilled_shafts"></a>\r\n                          <p class="text">\r\n  CJA offers design/build services for micropile installation and works closely with engineers, contractors, and owners to ensure a pile cross section that meets the performance requirements of the structural engineer and an installation method that achieves the necessary capacity while minimizing the disturbance to building occupants and existing foundations.\r\n\r\nMicropiles can be used to offer a cost effective way to provide tensile capacity to seismic upgrades, tensile and compression capacity to increase load carrying ability of new and existing footings, tensile and compression capacity to limited access work areas, and underpinning solutions for your earth retention challenges.

Drilled shafts, also known as drilled piers, Cast-in-Drilled-Hole Piles (CIDH piles), or Cast-in-Situ piles, are used to transfer structural loads and moments through the relatively weak upper strata of many sites to deeper, stronger soils which have sufficient capacity for the anticipated loading.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nDrilled shafts are deep, cylindrical, cast-in-place concrete foundations reinforced using full-length rebar cages and formed by a drilled borehole excavation. They can range in diameter from 18-inches to greater than 20-feet and reach depths over 250 feet. They are often used as a structural support where seismic loadings create large moment requirements which ultimately govern the bridge foundation design. Drilled shafts have additional foundation uses including building support, cantilevered signs, communication towers, and landslide retention.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nConstruction methods depend on the geology of the site and on-site access. CJA is competent with dry, wet (slurry), and oscillated/rotated cased drilling methods. Dry drilling methods are used in non-caving, cohesive soils, which are generally located above the local ground water table. An auger is advanced (it must be removed periodically to remove the borehole soils) until bottom of pile elevation is reached. A cleanout bucket is then used to ensure the bottom of the hole is free of debris.\r\nWet or slurry drilling methods are used where caving of the drilled borehole is probable, typically when the local ground water table is located within the length of the shaft. By maintaining the slurry or water above the ground water table while drilling, a positive pressure will be exerted on the sides of the shaft to prevent the inward flow of water and the likelihood of caving is reduced. There are three different classifications of drilling fluid: freshwater, mineral, or polymer.\r\n</p>\r\n<a name="displacement_piles"></a>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nCasing construction methods are applicable where wet or slurry drilling methods are used. The cased method uses a temporary steel casing that is installed in the excavation to provide the lateral support necessary for maintaining the integrity of the hole. CJA uses the latest European and North American innovations for \r\n\r\ninstallation of the casing using an oscillator or rotator to minimize vibrations while advancing casing from 3-ft to 10-ft in diameter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nOur drilled shafts are regularly tested using state-of-the art non-destructive testing techniques and receive approval ratings high above industry standards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for drilled shafts, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="title">Displacement Piles</div>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nAuger Displacement piles are similar to Auger-Cast Piles but instead of a continuous auger flight, the specialized screw shaped auger displaces the soils laterally toward the bore hole walls to increase the density of the surrounding soils and increase the capacity of the resulting pile. An added benefit of the displacement pile is that there are essentially no drill spoils generated by the installation process of a displacement pile. Aside from reducing the cost of spoils handling, the lack of spoils is even more significant for projects with contaminated soils. Displacement piles offer a cost saving approach and reduce the hazards of handling contaminated soils.\r\n</p>\r\n<a name="barettes"></a>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nAs the specialized auger drills, the soil is laterally displaced until tip of pile elevation is reached. High slump sand mix grout/concrete is then pumped out through the hollow stem auger as the tool is withdrawn from the bottom of the drill hole. After grouting of the pile is complete, a reinforcement cage is installed. The inherent soil improvement process of displacement pile installation results in greater lateral capacities compared to conventional in-situ piles. Displacement piles also offer a low-noise, vibration free installation process. A huge advantage of this is where deep foundation support is needed in sensitive areas where noise and vibrations are not allowed. Vibration or pile driving in areas of sensitive soils can cause settlement which can lead to project delays or claims.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nFor more information on the cost saving, design/build options, and environmental benefits that CJA’s expertise on displacement piles can offer your project, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="title">Barettes</div>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nBarettes are rectangular load bearing piles that are constructed under slurry. They are often used in conjunction with diaphragm wall construction due to the equipment/methodology being common between both techniques. Barettes are typically constructed in areas with dense/historic infrastructure where a rigid shoring system is required, noise and vibration are required to be limited, and dewatering is not considered practical to allow convention earth retention systems or where a top down construction technique is preferred.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nBarettes have a greater resistance to horizontal stress and bending movements than circular piles of the same section and due to their larger perimeter they have an increased lateral friction compared to a circular pile of the same section. Due to their mammoth size, barettes can lend themselves to top down or conventional basement construction methods on high rise buildings with deep basement excavations. Barettes can be constructed singular or jointed together for larger sizes. Excavation of the barette can extend into rock for higher loadings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for barettes, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<a name="auger_cast_piles"></a>\r\n<div class="title">Auger Cast Piles</div>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nAuger Cast piles, or Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles, are created by rotating a continuous flight auger into the ground to a specified depth and then slowly withdrawing the auger while pumping cementitious grout under pressure to create the pile as the auger is retracted. As the auger is retracted, the spoils on the auger are continuously removed by a small excavator or loader. Once the pile has been grouted and auger completely removed from the pile, reinforcing cages may then be set into the previously placed concrete.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nThe quality of the auger cast pile is largely dependent on the skill and experience of the contractor performing the work. Condon-Johnson & Associates is continuously selected for auger cast pile installation due to our vast experience and positive reviews from designers, contractors, and owners after the project is completed.\r\nFor more information on the cost saving benefits, design/build options, and CJA’s expertise on auger cast piles, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-center">\r\n\r\n                        <div class="image-wrapper">\r\n                            <div class="image image-color hidden-sm hidden-xs"></div>\r\n                            <div class="image image-lines"></div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Deep Foundation', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'deep-foundation', '', '', '2017-09-27 15:54:04', '2017-09-27 15:54:04', '', 0, 'http://cj/?page_id=140', 0, 'page', '', 0),

Micropiles are designed to carry compressive or tensile loads and can exceed depths of 200 feet with loads over 200 tons. The micropile casing typically ranges in diameter of 5 to 12 inches and is made of high-strength N-80 steel. The casing extends to the top of the bond zone or it can be plunged several feet into the bond zone to provide a stiff cross section and limit elastic deformation of the pile under load.\n                          </p>\n                          <p class="text">\n  Condon-Johnson & Associates (CJA) uses the latest technology and equipment for limited access micropile installation for virtually any location and every ground condition with minimal vibration and disturbance. Generally, micropiles are used when there is a relatively high tensile load requirement since grouting techniques allow much higher bond stress than conventional drilled or driven piles, excessive variation in the depth to soil or rock targeted for bond zone, and/or limited headroom. Our micropile drill rigs allow for installation in areas with low headroom and restricted access with minimal disturbance to normal facility operations. Micropiles are often additionally used to underpin existing buildings or to increase the bearing capacity for building upgrades or seismic retrofit.\n                          </p>\n<a name="drilled_shafts"></a>\n                          <p class="text">\n  CJA offers design/build services for micropile installation and works closely with engineers, contractors, and owners to ensure a pile cross section that meets the performance requirements of the structural engineer and an installation method that achieves the necessary capacity while minimizing the disturbance to building occupants and existing foundations.\n\nMicropiles can be used to offer a cost effective way to provide tensile capacity to seismic upgrades, tensile and compression capacity to increase load carrying ability of new and existing footings, tensile and compression capacity to limited access work areas, and underpinning solutions for your earth retention challenges.

Drilled shafts, also known as drilled piers, Cast-in-Drilled-Hole Piles (CIDH piles), or Cast-in-Situ piles, are used to transfer structural loads and moments through the relatively weak upper strata of many sites to deeper, stronger soils which have sufficient capacity for the anticipated loading.\n</p>\n<p class="text">\nDrilled shafts are deep, cylindrical, cast-in-place concrete foundations reinforced using full-length rebar cages and formed by a drilled borehole excavation. They can range in diameter from 18-inches to greater than 20-feet and reach depths over 250 feet. They are often used as a structural support where seismic loadings create large moment requirements which ultimately govern the bridge foundation design. Drilled shafts have additional foundation uses including building support, cantilevered signs, communication towers, and landslide retention.\n</p>\n<p class="text">\nConstruction methods depend on the geology of the site and on-site access. CJA is competent with dry, wet (slurry), and oscillated/rotated cased drilling methods. Dry drilling methods are used in non-caving, cohesive soils, which are generally located above the local ground water table. An auger is advanced (it must be removed periodically to remove the borehole soils) until bottom of pile elevation is reached. A cleanout bucket is then used to ensure the bottom of the hole is free of debris.\nWet or slurry drilling methods are used where caving of the drilled borehole is probable, typically when the local ground water table is located within the length of the shaft. By maintaining the slurry or water above the ground water table while drilling, a positive pressure will be exerted on the sides of the shaft to prevent the inward flow of water and the likelihood of caving is reduced. There are three different classifications of drilling fluid: freshwater, mineral, or polymer.\n</p>\n\n<p class="text">\nCasing construction methods are applicable where wet or slurry drilling methods are used. The cased method uses a temporary steel casing that is installed in the excavation to provide the lateral support necessary for maintaining the integrity of the hole. CJA uses the latest European and North American innovations for \n\ninstallation of the casing using an oscillator or rotator to minimize vibrations while advancing casing from 3-ft to 10-ft in diameter.\n</p>\n<p class="text">\nOur drilled shafts are regularly tested using state-of-the art non-destructive testing techniques and receive approval ratings high above industry standards.\n</p>\n<p class="text">\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for drilled shafts, please contact our nearest office location.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="title">Displacement Piles</div>\n<p class="text">\nAuger Displacement piles are similar to Auger-Cast Piles but instead of a continuous auger flight, the specialized screw shaped auger displaces the soils laterally toward the bore hole walls to increase the density of the surrounding soils and increase the capacity of the resulting pile. An added benefit of the displacement pile is that there are essentially no drill spoils generated by the installation process of a displacement pile. Aside from reducing the cost of spoils handling, the lack of spoils is even more significant for projects with contaminated soils. Displacement piles offer a cost saving approach and reduce the hazards of handling contaminated soils.\n</p>\n<a name="barettes"></a>\n<p class="text">\nAs the specialized auger drills, the soil is laterally displaced until tip of pile elevation is reached. High slump sand mix grout/concrete is then pumped out through the hollow stem auger as the tool is withdrawn from the bottom of the drill hole. After grouting of the pile is complete, a reinforcement cage is installed. The inherent soil improvement process of displacement pile installation results in greater lateral capacities compared to conventional in-situ piles. Displacement piles also offer a low-noise, vibration free installation process. A huge advantage of this is where deep foundation support is needed in sensitive areas where noise and vibrations are not allowed. Vibration or pile driving in areas of sensitive soils can cause settlement which can lead to project delays or claims.\n</p>\n<p class="text">\nFor more information on the cost saving, design/build options, and environmental benefits that CJA’s expertise on displacement piles can offer your project, please contact our nearest office location.\n</p>\n\n\n<div class="title">Barettes</div>\n<p class="text">\nBarettes are rectangular load bearing piles that are constructed under slurry. They are often used in conjunction with diaphragm wall construction due to the equipment/methodology being common between both techniques. Barettes are typically constructed in areas with dense/historic infrastructure where a rigid shoring system is required, noise and vibration are required to be limited, and dewatering is not considered practical to allow convention earth retention systems or where a top down construction technique is preferred.\n</p>\n<p class="text">\nBarettes have a greater resistance to horizontal stress and bending movements than circular piles of the same section and due to their larger perimeter they have an increased lateral friction compared to a circular pile of the same section. Due to their mammoth size, barettes can lend themselves to top down or conventional basement construction methods on high rise buildings with deep basement excavations. Barettes can be constructed singular or jointed together for larger sizes. Excavation of the barette can extend into rock for higher loadings.\n</p>\n<p class="text">\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for barettes, please contact our nearest office location.\n</p>\n\n<a name="auger_cast_piles"></a>\n<div class="title">Auger Cast Piles</div>\n<p class="text">\nAuger Cast piles, or Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles, are created by rotating a continuous flight auger into the ground to a specified depth and then slowly withdrawing the auger while pumping cementitious grout under pressure to create the pile as the auger is retracted. As the auger is retracted, the spoils on the auger are continuously removed by a small excavator or loader. Once the pile has been grouted and auger completely removed from the pile, reinforcing cages may then be set into the previously placed concrete.\n</p>\n<p class="text">\nThe quality of the auger cast pile is largely dependent on the skill and experience of the contractor performing the work. Condon-Johnson & Associates is continuously selected for auger cast pile installation due to our vast experience and positive reviews from designers, contractors, and owners after the project is completed.\nFor more information on the cost saving benefits, design/build options, and CJA’s expertise on auger cast piles, please contact our nearest office location.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-center">\n\n                        <div class="image-wrapper">\n                            <div class="image image-color hidden-sm hidden-xs"></div>\n                            <div class="image image-lines"></div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n\n\n', 'Deep Foundation', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '140-autosave-v1', '', '', '2017-09-27 15:53:03', '2017-09-27 15:53:03', '', 140, 'http://cj/2017/02/10/140-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Micropiles are often additionally used to underpin existing buildings or to increase the bearing capacity for building upgrades or seismic retrofit.\r\n                          </p>\r\n                          <p class="text">\r\n  CJA offers design/build services for micropile installation and works closely with engineers, contractors, and owners to ensure a pile cross section that meets the performance requirements of the structural engineer and an installation method that achieves the necessary capacity while minimizing the disturbance to building occupants and existing foundations.\r\nMicropiles can be used to offer a cost effective way to provide tensile capacity to seismic upgrades, tensile and compression capacity to increase load carrying ability of new and existing footings, tensile and compression capacity to limited access work areas, and underpinning solutions for your earth retention challenges.

Drilled shafts, also known as drilled piers, Cast-in-Drilled-Hole Piles (CIDH piles), or Cast-in-Situ piles, are used to transfer structural loads and moments through the relatively weak upper strata of many sites to deeper, stronger soils which have sufficient capacity for the anticipated loading.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nDrilled shafts are deep, cylindrical, cast-in-place concrete foundations reinforced using full-length rebar cages and formed by a drilled borehole excavation. They can range in diameter from 18-inches to greater than 20-feet and reach depths over 250 feet. They are often used as a structural support where seismic loadings create large moment requirements which ultimately govern the bridge foundation design. Drilled shafts have additional foundation uses including building support, cantilevered signs, communication towers, and landslide retention.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nConstruction methods depend on the geology of the site and on-site access. CJA is competent with dry, wet (slurry), and oscillated/rotated cased drilling methods. Dry drilling methods are used in non-caving, cohesive soils, which are generally located above the local ground water table. An auger is advanced (it must be removed periodically to remove the borehole soils) until bottom of pile elevation is reached. A cleanout bucket is then used to ensure the bottom of the hole is free of debris.\r\nWet or slurry drilling methods are used where caving of the drilled borehole is probable, typically when the local ground water table is located within the length of the shaft. By maintaining the slurry or water above the ground water table while drilling, a positive pressure will be exerted on the sides of the shaft to prevent the inward flow of water and the likelihood of caving is reduced. There are three different classifications of drilling fluid: freshwater, mineral, or polymer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nCasing construction methods are applicable where wet or slurry drilling methods are used. The cased method uses a temporary steel casing that is installed in the excavation to provide the lateral support necessary for maintaining the integrity of the hole. CJA uses the latest European and North American innovations for installation of the casing using an oscillator or rotator to minimize vibrations while advancing casing from 3-ft to 10-ft in diameter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nOur drilled shafts are regularly tested using state-of-the art non-destructive testing techniques and receive approval ratings high above industry standards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for drilled shafts, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="title">Displacement Piles</div>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nAuger Displacement piles are similar to Auger-Cast Piles but instead of a continuous auger flight, the specialized screw shaped auger displaces the soils laterally toward the bore hole walls to increase the density of the surrounding soils and increase the capacity of the resulting pile. An added benefit of the displacement pile is that there are essentially no drill spoils generated by the installation process of a displacement pile. Aside from reducing the cost of spoils handling, the lack of spoils is even more significant for projects with contaminated soils. Displacement piles offer a cost saving approach and reduce the hazards of handling contaminated soils.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nAs the specialized auger drills, the soil is laterally displaced until tip of pile elevation is reached. High slump sand mix grout/concrete is then pumped out through the hollow stem auger as the tool is withdrawn from the bottom of the drill hole. After grouting of the pile is complete, a reinforcement cage is installed. The inherent soil improvement process of displacement pile installation results in greater lateral capacities compared to conventional in-situ piles. Displacement piles also offer a low-noise, vibration free installation process. A huge advantage of this is where deep foundation support is needed in sensitive areas where noise and vibrations are not allowed. Vibration or pile driving in areas of sensitive soils can cause settlement which can lead to project delays or claims.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nFor more information on the cost saving, design/build options, and environmental benefits that CJA’s expertise on displacement piles can offer your project, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="title">Barettes</div>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nBarettes are rectangular load bearing piles that are constructed under slurry. They are often used in conjunction with diaphragm wall construction due to the equipment/methodology being common between both techniques. Barettes are typically constructed in areas with dense/historic infrastructure where a rigid shoring system is required, noise and vibration are required to be limited, and dewatering is not considered practical to allow convention earth retention systems or where a top down construction technique is preferred.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nBarettes have a greater resistance to horizontal stress and bending movements than circular piles of the same section and due to their larger perimeter they have an increased lateral friction compared to a circular pile of the same section. Due to their mammoth size, barettes can lend themselves to top down or conventional basement construction methods on high rise buildings with deep basement excavations. Barettes can be constructed singular or jointed together for larger sizes. Excavation of the barette can extend into rock for higher loadings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for barettes, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="title">Auger Cast Piles</div>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nAuger Cast piles, or Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles, are created by rotating a continuous flight auger into the ground to a specified depth and then slowly withdrawing the auger while pumping cementitious grout under pressure to create the pile as the auger is retracted. As the auger is retracted, the spoils on the auger are continuously removed by a small excavator or loader. Once the pile has been grouted and auger completely removed from the pile, reinforcing cages may then be set into the previously placed concrete.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nThe quality of the auger cast pile is largely dependent on the skill and experience of the contractor performing the work.

Tieback strands (or bar) consist of a high strength steel grouted into a drilled hole with a free stressing (unbonded) length and a bonded length. The unbonded length is the portion of the steel tendon that is allowed to elongate elastically and transfer the tensile load to the bond length. The bond length is where the tensile load is disturbed to the surrounding soils or rock to resist the loading. After the grout has reached 50% of design strength the tiebacks are stressed and locked off at a design load.\r\n                        </p>\r\n<a name="soldier_pile_walls"></a>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCJA has successfully installed tiebacks hundreds of feet deep with loads over 700 kips.

As the excavation progresses, horizontal timber lagging is installed between the piles in 5 foot “lifts” to resist the load of the retained soil and transfer the load to the piles. Depending on the depth of the excavation and the sensitivity of surrounding structures and utilities to movement, Post-tensioned anchors and/or internal bracing can then be installed at intervals to provide lateral support to the solider beams.

Next, the soil nail holes are drilled at a slight inclination and the threaded steel soil nail bar is inserted and grouted in a 4 to 6 inch diameter hole to insure that the soil acts as a coherent soil mass. This is designed to act as a gravity block to resist bearing capacity failure, sliding, and global rotation.\r\n                        </p>\r\n<a name="soldier_mixed_walls"></a>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThen, vertical water drainage strips are placed on the excavated soil face to ensure drainage and prevent build-up of hydrostatic pressures on the wall.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.

The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\n\n                        </p>\n                        <p class="text">\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.  Condon-Johnson owns and operates ABI mobilram equipment, which was designed specifically for the installation of sheet piling. The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\n                        </p>\n                        <p class="text">\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\n                        </p>\n                        <p class="text">\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques.\n\n<a name="shear_pins"></a>\n This can be seen on many of the different types of projects Condon-Johnson has completed including piling projects (sheet piling, soldier piling, and auger cast piling) and ground improvement projects (vibro-densification and soil mixing).

The intermediate piles are then installed after their adjacent piles have had some time to set-up.

CJA has a vast successful experience installing anchors for temporary excavation support, permanent retaining walls, landslide control, slope stabilization, marine bulkheads, marine tiedowns, and dam stabilization.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nTieback anchors (also called ground anchors) are pre-stressed structural elements used to transmit an applied tensile load into the competent soils in the bond zone. Tieback strands (or bar) consist of a high strength steel grouted into a drilled hole with a free stressing (unbonded) length and a bonded length. The unbonded length is the portion of the steel tendon that is allowed to elongate elastically and transfer the tensile load to the bond length. The bond length is where the tensile load is disturbed to the surrounding soils or rock to resist the loading. After the grout has reached 50% of design strength the tiebacks are stressed and locked off at a design load.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCJA has successfully installed tiebacks hundreds of feet deep with loads over 700 kips. Permanent tiebacks incorporate a corrosion protection system to increase the expected lift of the anchors in corrosive environments and/or when the anchors are permanent. Tiebacks can offer a cost-effective solution over cantilevered shoring solutions (when the excavation is greater than 13 feet) and can be installed when limited access limits construction methods.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise, design/build options, and services for tieback and ground anchors, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n                       \r\n                        <div class="title">Soldier Pile Walls</div>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCJA’s team has constructed cantilevered, anchored with tiebacks, and internally braced soldier pile walls throughout the West Coast for a wide range of projects. Soldier pile walls can be permanent or temporary in nature and are commonly used to support open excavations next to adjacent roads, utilities, and structures, and to provide permanent support for new highway cuts or existing land slide conditions.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSoldier pile walls consist of wide flange steel piles that are driven or drilled into the ground 6 to 8 feet apart along the wall alignment before excavation begins. As the excavation progresses, horizontal timber lagging is installed between the piles in 5 foot “lifts” to resist the load of the retained soil and transfer the load to the piles. Depending on the depth of the excavation and the sensitivity of surrounding structures and utilities to movement, Post-tensioned anchors and/or internal bracing can then be installed at intervals to provide lateral support to the solider beams. The lagging “lift” and excavation cycle continues until the bottom of excavation depth is reached.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSoldier pile walls can be either temporary or permanent. Pre-cast lagging can also be used instead of wood for a longer service life with corrosion protection added to the beam and anchors.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCJA offers a variety of services related to soldier pile walls such as design/build services, construction, permanent shotcrete facing, and shotcrete sculpting for a “natural stone” appearance.

Soil nailing can be used for both temporary and permanent earth retention applications, and permanent slope stabilization.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSoil nailing is an earth retention technique using grouted tension-resisting steel bars (soil nails) and shotcrete facing to stabilize a section of ground as excavation proceeds from the top down.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe first step of construction is the excavation of the “lift” from the top down to a predetermined height which is typically 4 to 6 feet below existing grade. Next, the soil nail holes are drilled at a slight inclination and the threaded steel soil nail bar is inserted and grouted in a 4 to 6 inch diameter hole to insure that the soil acts as a coherent soil mass. This is designed to act as a gravity block to resist bearing capacity failure, sliding, and global rotation.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThen, vertical water drainage strips are placed on the excavated soil face to ensure drainage and prevent build-up of hydrostatic pressures on the wall. Metal reinforcing is then installed and shotcrete is applied to the exposed soil face. Excavation then resumes for the next lift. A rod-finish is applied to the shotcrete for temporary walls. Permanent shotcrete walls often have a second layer of shotcrete applied that is typically sculpted and colored to replicate local rock formations.\r\nSoil nail walls can offer a reduced construction time and cost savings compared to other shoring systems.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.  Condon-Johnson owns and operates ABI mobilram equipment, which was designed specifically for the installation of sheet piling. The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques. This can be seen on many of the different types of projects Condon-Johnson has completed including piling projects (sheet piling, soldier piling, and auger cast piling) and ground improvement projects (vibro-densification and soil mixing). In using the right tools for the job, Condon-Johnson has become an industry leader in the construction of specialty foundations.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nFor more information on the cost saving benefits and CJA’s expertise on sheet piling, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <div class="title">Shear Pins</div>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nShear Pin refers to steel beam or steel bar reinforced drilled shafts to reinforce slopes.  Shear Pin design should consider both shear force and bending moments.  Shear pins can be combined with tiebacks for additional lateral restraint.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <div class="title">Secant Pile Systems</div>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSecant pile wall systems are constructed using the auger cast pile method or cased drilled shaft technique so that there is an overlap between one pile to the adjacent piles. Usually the piles are installed in an alternative fashion along the line of the wall leaving a clear space of a little under the diameter of the required intermediate piles. The intermediate piles are then installed after their adjacent piles have had some time to set-up. Condon-Johnson & Associates is experienced in building hard/soft, hard/firm, and hard/hard secant pile walls over 150 feet deep.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nIn a tangent pile wall, there is no overlap as the piles are constructed flush to each other. Both types of piles are reinforced with either steel rebar or with steel beams. Where the bottom of the excavation is below the ground water table and water permeability is a requirement, secant walls systems can be combined with jet grouting at the base of the excavation “bottom plug” so that the excavation remains watertight.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSecant pile walls offer an increased stiffness compared to sheet pile walls, decreased noise during installation, and are installed with minimized vibrations using an oscillator for sensitive areas where settlement and/or noise is an issue. Due to Condon-Johnson and Associate’s innovative construction methods and modern drill equipment, we are able to install secant or tangent pile walls in the most challenging urban environments with minimal impact to adjacent structures, utilities, and/or roadways.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise, design/build options, and services for secant and tangent pile walls, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <div class="title">Internal Bracing</div>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nInternally braced shoring systems consist of rakers or struts used to resist active earth pressures and surcharge loading without the use of anchors. Soldier piles are typically installed around the perimeter of the excavation and the internal bracing is placed as the excavation progresses downward. Internally braced shoring systems can be extended to depths of 100 feet and are often used when there are property line and utility boundaries or when installing anchors is not possible due to site conditions.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nRakers are structural steel members that diagonally brace vertical walls by transferring the load to the bottom of the excavation.

The grout is typically injected up stage as the injection pipe is extracted in 2-ft to 3-ft stages to to create a column of overlapping grout bulbs.\n                        </p>\n                        <p class="text">\nGrout is usually injected until a predetermined volume is injected or a pressure at a given injection rate is reached.

Tieback strands (or bar) consist of a high strength steel grouted into a drilled hole with a free stressing (unbonded) length and a bonded length. The unbonded length is the portion of the steel tendon that is allowed to elongate elastically and transfer the tensile load to the bond length. The bond length is where the tensile load is disturbed to the surrounding soils or rock to resist the loading. After the grout has reached 50% of design strength the tiebacks are stressed and locked off at a design load.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCJA has successfully installed tiebacks hundreds of feet deep with loads over 700 kips. Permanent tiebacks incorporate a corrosion protection system to increase the expected lift of the anchors in corrosive environments and/or when the anchors are permanent.

As the excavation progresses, horizontal timber lagging is installed between the piles in 5 foot “lifts” to resist the load of the retained soil and transfer the load to the piles. Depending on the depth of the excavation and the sensitivity of surrounding structures and utilities to movement, Post-tensioned anchors and/or internal bracing can then be installed at intervals to provide lateral support to the solider beams. The lagging “lift” and excavation cycle continues until the bottom of excavation depth is reached.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSoldier pile walls can be either temporary or permanent.

Soil nailing can be used for both temporary and permanent earth retention applications, and permanent slope stabilization.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSoil nailing is an earth retention technique using grouted tension-resisting steel bars (soil nails) and shotcrete facing to stabilize a section of ground as excavation proceeds from the top down.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe first step of construction is the excavation of the “lift” from the top down to a predetermined height which is typically 4 to 6 feet below existing grade. Next, the soil nail holes are drilled at a slight inclination and the threaded steel soil nail bar is inserted and grouted in a 4 to 6 inch diameter hole to insure that the soil acts as a coherent soil mass. This is designed to act as a gravity block to resist bearing capacity failure, sliding, and global rotation.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThen, vertical water drainage strips are placed on the excavated soil face to ensure drainage and prevent build-up of hydrostatic pressures on the wall. Metal reinforcing is then installed and shotcrete is applied to the exposed soil face. Excavation then resumes for the next lift. A rod-finish is applied to the shotcrete for temporary walls.

Tieback strands (or bar) consist of a high strength steel grouted into a drilled hole with a free stressing (unbonded) length and a bonded length. The unbonded length is the portion of the steel tendon that is allowed to elongate elastically and transfer the tensile load to the bond length. The bond length is where the tensile load is disturbed to the surrounding soils or rock to resist the loading. After the grout has reached 50% of design strength the tiebacks are stressed and locked off at a design load.\r\n                        </p>\r\n<a name="soldier_pile_walls"></a>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCJA has successfully installed tiebacks hundreds of feet deep with loads over 700 kips.

As the excavation progresses, horizontal timber lagging is installed between the piles in 5 foot “lifts” to resist the load of the retained soil and transfer the load to the piles. Depending on the depth of the excavation and the sensitivity of surrounding structures and utilities to movement, Post-tensioned anchors and/or internal bracing can then be installed at intervals to provide lateral support to the solider beams.

Next, the soil nail holes are drilled at a slight inclination and the threaded steel soil nail bar is inserted and grouted in a 4 to 6 inch diameter hole to insure that the soil acts as a coherent soil mass. This is designed to act as a gravity block to resist bearing capacity failure, sliding, and global rotation.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThen, vertical water drainage strips are placed on the excavated soil face to ensure drainage and prevent build-up of hydrostatic pressures on the wall.

Next, the soil nail holes are drilled at a slight inclination and the threaded steel soil nail bar is inserted and grouted in a 4 to 6 inch diameter hole to insure that the soil acts as a coherent soil mass. This is designed to act as a gravity block to resist bearing capacity failure, sliding, and global rotation.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThen, vertical water drainage strips are placed on the excavated soil face to ensure drainage and prevent build-up of hydrostatic pressures on the wall. Metal reinforcing is then installed and shotcrete is applied to the exposed soil face. Excavation then resumes for the next lift. A rod-finish is applied to the shotcrete for temporary walls. Permanent shotcrete walls often have a second layer of shotcrete applied that is typically sculpted and colored to replicate local rock formations.\r\nSoil nail walls can offer a reduced construction time and cost savings compared to other shoring systems.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.  Condon-Johnson owns and operates ABI mobilram equipment, which was designed specifically for the installation of sheet piling. The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques. This can be seen on many of the different types of projects Condon-Johnson has completed including piling projects (sheet piling, soldier piling, and auger cast piling) and ground improvement projects (vibro-densification and soil mixing). In using the right tools for the job, Condon-Johnson has become an industry leader in the construction of specialty foundations.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nFor more information on the cost saving benefits and CJA’s expertise on sheet piling, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <div class="title">Shear Pins</div>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nShear Pin refers to steel beam or steel bar reinforced drilled shafts to reinforce slopes.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.  Condon-Johnson owns and operates ABI mobilram equipment, which was designed specifically for the installation of sheet piling. The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques. This can be seen on many of the different types of projects Condon-Johnson has completed including piling projects (sheet piling, soldier piling, and auger cast piling) and ground improvement projects (vibro-densification and soil mixing). In using the right tools for the job, Condon-Johnson has become an industry leader in the construction of specialty foundations.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nFor more information on the cost saving benefits and CJA’s expertise on sheet piling, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <div class="title">Shear Pins</div>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nShear Pin refers to steel beam or steel bar reinforced drilled shafts to reinforce slopes.

Shear pins can be combined with tiebacks for additional lateral restraint.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <div class="title">Secant Pile Systems</div>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSecant pile wall systems are constructed using the auger cast pile method or cased drilled shaft technique so that there is an overlap between one pile to the adjacent piles. Usually the piles are installed in an alternative fashion along the line of the wall leaving a clear space of a little under the diameter of the required intermediate piles. The intermediate piles are then installed after their adjacent piles have had some time to set-up. Condon-Johnson & Associates is experienced in building hard/soft, hard/firm, and hard/hard secant pile walls over 150 feet deep.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nIn a tangent pile wall, there is no overlap as the piles are constructed flush to each other. Both types of piles are reinforced with either steel rebar or with steel beams. Where the bottom of the excavation is below the ground water table and water permeability is a requirement, secant walls systems can be combined with jet grouting at the base of the excavation “bottom plug” so that the excavation remains watertight.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSecant pile walls offer an increased stiffness compared to sheet pile walls, decreased noise during installation, and are installed with minimized vibrations using an oscillator for sensitive areas where settlement and/or noise is an issue.

Soldier piles are typically installed around the perimeter of the excavation and the internal bracing is placed as the excavation progresses downward.

Tieback strands (or bar) consist of a high strength steel grouted into a drilled hole with a free stressing (unbonded) length and a bonded length. The unbonded length is the portion of the steel tendon that is allowed to elongate elastically and transfer the tensile load to the bond length. The bond length is where the tensile load is disturbed to the surrounding soils or rock to resist the loading. After the grout has reached 50% of design strength the tiebacks are stressed and locked off at a design load.\r\n                        </p>\r\n<a name="soldier_pile_walls"></a>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCJA has successfully installed tiebacks hundreds of feet deep with loads over 700 kips.

Tieback strands (or bar) consist of a high strength steel grouted into a drilled hole with a free stressing (unbonded) length and a bonded length. The unbonded length is the portion of the steel tendon that is allowed to elongate elastically and transfer the tensile load to the bond length. The bond length is where the tensile load is disturbed to the surrounding soils or rock to resist the loading. After the grout has reached 50% of design strength the tiebacks are stressed and locked off at a design load.\r\n                        </p>\r\n<a name="soldier_pile_walls"></a>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCJA has successfully installed tiebacks hundreds of feet deep with loads over 700 kips.

As the excavation progresses, horizontal timber lagging is installed between the piles in 5 foot “lifts” to resist the load of the retained soil and transfer the load to the piles. Depending on the depth of the excavation and the sensitivity of surrounding structures and utilities to movement, Post-tensioned anchors and/or internal bracing can then be installed at intervals to provide lateral support to the solider beams.

Next, the soil nail holes are drilled at a slight inclination and the threaded steel soil nail bar is inserted and grouted in a 4 to 6 inch diameter hole to insure that the soil acts as a coherent soil mass. This is designed to act as a gravity block to resist bearing capacity failure, sliding, and global rotation.\r\n                        </p>\r\n<a name="soldier_mixed_walls"></a>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThen, vertical water drainage strips are placed on the excavated soil face to ensure drainage and prevent build-up of hydrostatic pressures on the wall.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.  Condon-Johnson owns and operates ABI mobilram equipment, which was designed specifically for the installation of sheet piling. The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques. This can be seen on many of the different types of projects Condon-Johnson has completed including piling projects (sheet piling, soldier piling, and auger cast piling) and ground improvement projects (vibro-densification and soil mixing). In using the right tools for the job, Condon-Johnson has become an industry leader in the construction of specialty foundations.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nFor more information on the cost saving benefits and CJA’s expertise on sheet piling, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        <div class="title">Shear Pins</div>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nShear Pin refers to steel beam or steel bar reinforced drilled shafts to reinforce slopes.

Usually the piles are installed in an alternative fashion along the line of the wall leaving a clear space of a little under the diameter of the required intermediate piles. The intermediate piles are then installed after their adjacent piles have had some time to set-up. Condon-Johnson & Associates is experienced in building hard/soft, hard/firm, and hard/hard secant pile walls over 150 feet deep.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nIn a tangent pile wall, there is no overlap as the piles are constructed flush to each other. Both types of piles are reinforced with either steel rebar or with steel beams. Where the bottom of the excavation is below the ground water table and water permeability is a requirement, secant walls systems can be combined with jet grouting at the base of the excavation “bottom plug” so that the excavation remains watertight.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSecant pile walls offer an increased stiffness compared to sheet pile walls, decreased noise during installation, and are installed with minimized vibrations using an oscillator for sensitive areas where settlement and/or noise is an issue.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.  Condon-Johnson owns and operates ABI mobilram equipment, which was designed specifically for the installation of sheet piling. The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques.\r\n\r\n<a name="shear_pins"></a>\r\n This can be seen on many of the different types of projects Condon-Johnson has completed including piling projects (sheet piling, soldier piling, and auger cast piling) and ground improvement projects (vibro-densification and soil mixing).

Usually the piles are installed in an alternative fashion along the line of the wall leaving a clear space of a little under the diameter of the required intermediate piles. The intermediate piles are then installed after their adjacent piles have had some time to set-up. Condon-Johnson & Associates is experienced in building hard/soft, hard/firm, and hard/hard secant pile walls over 150 feet deep.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nIn a tangent pile wall, there is no overlap as the piles are constructed flush to each other. Both types of piles are reinforced with either steel rebar or with steel beams. Where the bottom of the excavation is below the ground water table and water permeability is a requirement, secant walls systems can be combined with jet grouting at the base of the excavation “bottom plug” so that the excavation remains watertight.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSecant pile walls offer an increased stiffness compared to sheet pile walls, decreased noise during installation, and are installed with minimized vibrations using an oscillator for sensitive areas where settlement and/or noise is an issue.

Tieback strands (or bar) consist of a high strength steel grouted into a drilled hole with a free stressing (unbonded) length and a bonded length. The unbonded length is the portion of the steel tendon that is allowed to elongate elastically and transfer the tensile load to the bond length. The bond length is where the tensile load is disturbed to the surrounding soils or rock to resist the loading. After the grout has reached 50% of design strength the tiebacks are stressed and locked off at a design load.\r\n                        </p>\r\n<a name="soldier_pile_walls"></a>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCJA has successfully installed tiebacks hundreds of feet deep with loads over 700 kips.

Tieback strands (or bar) consist of a high strength steel grouted into a drilled hole with a free stressing (unbonded) length and a bonded length. The unbonded length is the portion of the steel tendon that is allowed to elongate elastically and transfer the tensile load to the bond length. The bond length is where the tensile load is disturbed to the surrounding soils or rock to resist the loading. After the grout has reached 50% of design strength the tiebacks are stressed and locked off at a design load.\r\n                        </p>\r\n<a name="soldier_pile_walls"></a>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCJA has successfully installed tiebacks hundreds of feet deep with loads over 700 kips.

As the excavation progresses, horizontal timber lagging is installed between the piles in 5 foot “lifts” to resist the load of the retained soil and transfer the load to the piles. Depending on the depth of the excavation and the sensitivity of surrounding structures and utilities to movement, Post-tensioned anchors and/or internal bracing can then be installed at intervals to provide lateral support to the solider beams. The lagging “lift” and excavation cycle continues until the bottom of excavation depth is reached.\r\n                        </p>\r\n<a name="soldier_nail_walls"></a>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nSoldier pile walls can be either temporary or permanent.

Next, the soil nail holes are drilled at a slight inclination and the threaded steel soil nail bar is inserted and grouted in a 4 to 6 inch diameter hole to insure that the soil acts as a coherent soil mass. This is designed to act as a gravity block to resist bearing capacity failure, sliding, and global rotation.\r\n                        </p>\r\n<a name="soldier_mixed_walls"></a>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThen, vertical water drainage strips are placed on the excavated soil face to ensure drainage and prevent build-up of hydrostatic pressures on the wall. Metal reinforcing is then installed and shotcrete is applied to the exposed soil face. Excavation then resumes for the next lift. A rod-finish is applied to the shotcrete for temporary walls. Permanent shotcrete walls often have a second layer of shotcrete applied that is typically sculpted and colored to replicate local rock formations.\r\nSoil nail walls can offer a reduced construction time and cost savings compared to other shoring systems.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.  Condon-Johnson owns and operates ABI mobilram equipment, which was designed specifically for the installation of sheet piling. The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques.\r\n\r\n<a name="shear_pins"></a>\r\n This can be seen on many of the different types of projects Condon-Johnson has completed including piling projects (sheet piling, soldier piling, and auger cast piling) and ground improvement projects (vibro-densification and soil mixing).

Usually the piles are installed in an alternative fashion along the line of the wall leaving a clear space of a little under the diameter of the required intermediate piles. The intermediate piles are then installed after their adjacent piles have had some time to set-up.

Sheet piles use a mechanical interlock which creates a continuous water tight seal if installed properly.  Sheet pile materials can be steel, vinyl, or composite, depending on the application. In the past, sheet pile walls were constructed with methods of brute force, using large cranes and a variety of heavy hammers. The sheets would typically be laced with the crane and held vertical in a large steel template that had to be designed and fabricated for each job.  The piles were then driven down in incremental stages in order to maintain alignment and minimize interlock binding.  These conventional methods are slow and inefficient, and the costs of mobilization and operation often make sheet pile walls an expensive option.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nCondon-Johnson’s innovative equipment and methods of installation, now make sheet piling a more viable option.

The ABI runs on a track mounted carrier with an extendable vertical mast. Vibratory hammers, impact hammers, presses, drills or other attachments are mounted to the mast depending on job requirements. Positive and precise control of the piles during installation is now possible with powerful hydraulics capable of articulation in all directions. With the ABI mobilram, sheet pile driving occurs in a single stroke, without the use of a template and requires a smaller crew than conventional methods.  Mobilization is also much more efficient, as the ABI is transported on a single truck and set up in a matter of hours. The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques.\r\n\r\n<a name="shear_pins"></a>\r\n This can be seen on many of the different types of projects Condon-Johnson has completed including piling projects (sheet piling, soldier piling, and auger cast piling) and ground improvement projects (vibro-densification and soil mixing).

Tieback strands (or bar) consist of a high strength steel grouted into a drilled hole with a free stressing (unbonded) length and a bonded length. The unbonded length is the portion of the steel tendon that is allowed to elongate elastically and transfer the tensile load to the bond length. The bond length is where the tensile load is disturbed to the surrounding soils or rock to resist the loading.

The result is faster and higher quality sheet piling installation, with reduced construction costs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nThe ability to maintain precise verticality and alignment is especially important in the installation of vinyl and composite sheet piling. Steel interlocks can be strong enough to hold together when driven slightly out of alignment, whereas plastic and fiberglass interlocks simply break. These sensitive materials can’t be forced into place, and great care is required during installation.  Condon-Johnson’s methods of installation provide a high level of quality for vinyl and composite sheet piling projects.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nAfter many years of owning and operating various types and sizes of ABI equipment, Condon-Johnson has learned how to use it in innovative ways and has in fact developed state-of-the-art construction techniques.\r\n\r\n<a name="shear_pins"></a>\r\n This can be seen on many of the different types of projects Condon-Johnson has completed including piling projects (sheet piling, soldier piling, and auger cast piling) and ground improvement projects (vibro-densification and soil mixing).

Usually the piles are installed in an alternative fashion along the line of the wall leaving a clear space of a little under the diameter of the required intermediate piles. The intermediate piles are then installed after their adjacent piles have had some time to set-up. Condon-Johnson & Associates is experienced in building hard/soft, hard/firm, and hard/hard secant pile walls over 150 feet deep.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class="text">\r\nIn a tangent pile wall, there is no overlap as the piles are constructed flush to each other.

Drilled shafts, also known as drilled piers, Cast-in-Drilled-Hole Piles (CIDH piles), or Cast-in-Situ piles, are used to transfer structural loads and moments through the relatively weak upper strata of many sites to deeper, stronger soils which have sufficient capacity for the anticipated loading.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nDrilled shafts are deep, cylindrical, cast-in-place concrete foundations reinforced using full-length rebar cages and formed by a drilled borehole excavation. They can range in diameter from 18-inches to greater than 20-feet and reach depths over 250 feet. They are often used as a structural support where seismic loadings create large moment requirements which ultimately govern the bridge foundation design. Drilled shafts have additional foundation uses including building support, cantilevered signs, communication towers, and landslide retention.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nConstruction methods depend on the geology of the site and on-site access. CJA is competent with dry, wet (slurry), and oscillated/rotated cased drilling methods. Dry drilling methods are used in non-caving, cohesive soils, which are generally located above the local ground water table. An auger is advanced (it must be removed periodically to remove the borehole soils) until bottom of pile elevation is reached. A cleanout bucket is then used to ensure the bottom of the hole is free of debris.\r\nWet or slurry drilling methods are used where caving of the drilled borehole is probable, typically when the local ground water table is located within the length of the shaft. By maintaining the slurry or water above the ground water table while drilling, a positive pressure will be exerted on the sides of the shaft to prevent the inward flow of water and the likelihood of caving is reduced.

Our micropile drill rigs allow for installation in areas with low headroom and restricted access with minimal disturbance to normal facility operations. Micropiles are often additionally used to underpin existing buildings or to increase the bearing capacity for building upgrades or seismic retrofit.\r\n                          </p>\r\n<a name="drilled_shafts"></a>\r\n                          <p class="text">\r\n  CJA offers design/build services for micropile installation and works closely with engineers, contractors, and owners to ensure a pile cross section that meets the performance requirements of the structural engineer and an installation method that achieves the necessary capacity while minimizing the disturbance to building occupants and existing foundations.\r\n\r\nMicropiles can be used to offer a cost effective way to provide tensile capacity to seismic upgrades, tensile and compression capacity to increase load carrying ability of new and existing footings, tensile and compression capacity to limited access work areas, and underpinning solutions for your earth retention challenges.

Drilled shafts, also known as drilled piers, Cast-in-Drilled-Hole Piles (CIDH piles), or Cast-in-Situ piles, are used to transfer structural loads and moments through the relatively weak upper strata of many sites to deeper, stronger soils which have sufficient capacity for the anticipated loading.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nDrilled shafts are deep, cylindrical, cast-in-place concrete foundations reinforced using full-length rebar cages and formed by a drilled borehole excavation. They can range in diameter from 18-inches to greater than 20-feet and reach depths over 250 feet. They are often used as a structural support where seismic loadings create large moment requirements which ultimately govern the bridge foundation design. Drilled shafts have additional foundation uses including building support, cantilevered signs, communication towers, and landslide retention.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nConstruction methods depend on the geology of the site and on-site access. CJA is competent with dry, wet (slurry), and oscillated/rotated cased drilling methods. Dry drilling methods are used in non-caving, cohesive soils, which are generally located above the local ground water table. An auger is advanced (it must be removed periodically to remove the borehole soils) until bottom of pile elevation is reached. A cleanout bucket is then used to ensure the bottom of the hole is free of debris.\r\nWet or slurry drilling methods are used where caving of the drilled borehole is probable, typically when the local ground water table is located within the length of the shaft. By maintaining the slurry or water above the ground water table while drilling, a positive pressure will be exerted on the sides of the shaft to prevent the inward flow of water and the likelihood of caving is reduced. There are three different classifications of drilling fluid: freshwater, mineral, or polymer.\r\n</p>\r\n<a name="displacement_piles"></a>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nCasing construction methods are applicable where wet or slurry drilling methods are used. The cased method uses a temporary steel casing that is installed in the excavation to provide the lateral support necessary for maintaining the integrity of the hole. CJA uses the latest European and North American innovations for \r\n\r\ninstallation of the casing using an oscillator or rotator to minimize vibrations while advancing casing from 3-ft to 10-ft in diameter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nOur drilled shafts are regularly tested using state-of-the art non-destructive testing techniques and receive approval ratings high above industry standards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for drilled shafts, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="title">Displacement Piles</div>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nAuger Displacement piles are similar to Auger-Cast Piles but instead of a continuous auger flight, the specialized screw shaped auger displaces the soils laterally toward the bore hole walls to increase the density of the surrounding soils and increase the capacity of the resulting pile. An added benefit of the displacement pile is that there are essentially no drill spoils generated by the installation process of a displacement pile. Aside from reducing the cost of spoils handling, the lack of spoils is even more significant for projects with contaminated soils. Displacement piles offer a cost saving approach and reduce the hazards of handling contaminated soils.\r\n</p>\r\n<a name="barettes"></a>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nAs the specialized auger drills, the soil is laterally displaced until tip of pile elevation is reached. High slump sand mix grout/concrete is then pumped out through the hollow stem auger as the tool is withdrawn from the bottom of the drill hole. After grouting of the pile is complete, a reinforcement cage is installed. The inherent soil improvement process of displacement pile installation results in greater lateral capacities compared to conventional in-situ piles. Displacement piles also offer a low-noise, vibration free installation process. A huge advantage of this is where deep foundation support is needed in sensitive areas where noise and vibrations are not allowed. Vibration or pile driving in areas of sensitive soils can cause settlement which can lead to project delays or claims.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nFor more information on the cost saving, design/build options, and environmental benefits that CJA’s expertise on displacement piles can offer your project, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="title">Barettes</div>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nBarettes are rectangular load bearing piles that are constructed under slurry. They are often used in conjunction with diaphragm wall construction due to the equipment/methodology being common between both techniques. Barettes are typically constructed in areas with dense/historic infrastructure where a rigid shoring system is required, noise and vibration are required to be limited, and dewatering is not considered practical to allow convention earth retention systems or where a top down construction technique is preferred.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nBarettes have a greater resistance to horizontal stress and bending movements than circular piles of the same section and due to their larger perimeter they have an increased lateral friction compared to a circular pile of the same section. Due to their mammoth size, barettes can lend themselves to top down or conventional basement construction methods on high rise buildings with deep basement excavations. Barettes can be constructed singular or jointed together for larger sizes. Excavation of the barette can extend into rock for higher loadings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nFor more information on CJA’s expertise and services for barettes, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<a name="auger_cast_piles"></a>\r\n<div class="title">Auger Cast Piles</div>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nAuger Cast piles, or Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles, are created by rotating a continuous flight auger into the ground to a specified depth and then slowly withdrawing the auger while pumping cementitious grout under pressure to create the pile as the auger is retracted. As the auger is retracted, the spoils on the auger are continuously removed by a small excavator or loader. Once the pile has been grouted and auger completely removed from the pile, reinforcing cages may then be set into the previously placed concrete.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class="text">\r\nThe quality of the auger cast pile is largely dependent on the skill and experience of the contractor performing the work. Condon-Johnson & Associates is continuously selected for auger cast pile installation due to our vast experience and positive reviews from designers, contractors, and owners after the project is completed.\r\nFor more information on the cost saving benefits, design/build options, and CJA’s expertise on auger cast piles, please contact our nearest office location.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-center">\r\n\r\n                        <div class="image-wrapper">\r\n                            <div class="image image-color hidden-sm hidden-xs"></div>\r\n                            <div class="image image-lines"></div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Deep Foundation', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '140-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-09-27 15:54:04', '2017-09-27 15:54:04', '', 140, 'http://cj/2017/09/27/140-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
